what do you think of names for musical notes like do re mi rather than letters like E C G?,"in america, do re mi is relative, it just means scale degrees, like nashville uses numbers. they work according to the key your in, so do is always the root of the key but not always the same letter note. i have heard that in some countries 'do' always means C. it is 2 completely different ways of using the system, and i'm not sure either way is more useful than using letters and numbers."

"Hey Bill, regarding the 8.19.171:53 am question about reading sheet music. I am not the guy/gal who asked this question. But I would like to know what step 2 is (I have some staff paper). I know how to read sheet music (I know the notes that correspond to the lines/spaces of the treble and bass clef), and I know how to read rhythmic notation... But I have a hard time actually just sight reading and playing a piece fluently without having to take a second to figure out each note/rhythm pattern. (Maybe i'm skipping a couple of steps in your step-by-step system)?","just go to the store and get a book of songs and start practicing. read just the melodies if you want. do it with a metronome. set it slow enough so that you can do it. maybe even be aware of you handicap compared to the original tempo, for example maybe 75% is reasonable. so if the song is marked 100bpm, set your metronome to 75. or maybe even 50 if you need to. and practice looking ahead. that's the key to the game."

"thanks for the help earlier! i'm the one learning the peter gabriel song Here Comes the Flood. (i'm not asking about theory btw hahahaha, please don't move to space, we like having you here.) what i'm trying to learn is the full, accurate piano part in the original key, from the Shaking The Tree version. i don't think i communicated my questions very well though, or at all, so i'll try again.i have experience in percussion, but also some guitar and mandolin, learning with tabs and by ear - i'm the one that thinks strings sound soapy. but i can JUST BARELY read music at all. i am teaching myself piano, and how to read music. right now my ears are ahead of my fingers and feet, which are all MILES ahead of what i can actually read. there's a lot of music language that i've been exposed to but don't really understand yet. i want to learn this stuff so i can play and communicate with others better, and to be able to write down things i make  up.my strategy is: A) have fun learning songs that i like as accurately as i can, by ear. B) learn to read using beginner music books and get frustrated because i can only read things like hot cross buns so far. (maybe a tad more advanced than that.) it was fairly equal a month ago but now i spend 95% of the time i play on A and 5% on B. so, i haven't progressed on reading much. that's problem 1.problem 2 is: i think i have a pretty good ear. BUT i sometimes hit a limit: when it gets to be 5 or 6 or more keys pressed at the same time, it all starts to sound like One Big Thing and i have trouble distinguishing the notes, especially low ones. (keep in mind that i can't NAME the notes/chords from hearing them, i can just copy what i hear after hunting around a bit.) i know some musicians are able to identify notes in big chords really easily and accurately, and it seems almost like they were just born with that ability, which is kind of scary,?","i think if you keep using a pause and hunt strategy, (make sure you are using a local copy of the file, not streaming. if it's streaming like on youtube or something you're never gonna be able to unpause-pause as quickly as you need to) if you keep using the pause and hunt strategy for more and more songs, you will learn more and more and there will be less and less things that confuse you, and less and less things that fall outside your familiar classification system. if there are any chords or notes you are wondering about, i will be able to tell you if you show me where you heard it."

Are the blurred out bits on that list in your reality videos?,there are many different lists shown in reality videos.
can you explain the symbolism of the cats discussingrestructuring the fabric of the known universe in the music video for i wanna be a movie star?,"sure. i had that sign with the lyric on it everyone wants more than just a friend and also no zoom/twist, and i was concerned that it was a weak spot in the video, so i needed to put something there. the line is kind of corny/mushy -- not necessarily a bad thing, but i just needed to add something visually to spice it up. and i couldn't really think of anything that would exactly represent the line, becaues the line itself is sort of ambiguous more than just a friend could mean different things. so there was no obvious choice for what to put visually to match that. so i was willing to think abstractly, and wanted to do something crazy to distract from it being a dull moment, as i said. a cat seemed nice. and then i just decided to put them all circling the screen because i thought that would be an interesting effect. then i thought of putting a thought bubble and then i thought of something to put in it. overall i think it was a good solution, and that moment is now much more interesting than it was without the cats. to prove it, i cite the fact that you are interested."
are you ever going to add anything more to improv or is that page basically 'complete' for you?,"it's barely started. the project was cut way short. i built the entire reality/improv sections during feb-may, 2016 (right after the release of history of japan) and the whole project just dragged on and on for so long, and i was 3 months into it and no 'real' videos had come out on the main channel(s) so i was desperate to get out of the project as soon as possible. i barely even got started on the improv page."

How does one figure out the time signature of a song? I know what time signatures are but I have no idea how to figure them out in songs that are more than just like one instrument (so most songs)?,"step 1 is, find the beat. so as the music is going, see where you would tap your foot or nod your head, or wave your conducting wand. in most songs, this is pretty easy to find. of course you could always make crazy songs where you can't find it, but in Most songs you can find it. however, in most songs you can also do it twice as slow (or half as fast) if you want. in some songs, it is at just a certain tempo that you're almost not sure whether to tap the beat at one speed or twice as fast. this is ok, any piece of music can be written in multiple ways, you could set the tempo twice as fast and write all the notes as half the values and it would mean the same thing. but in most songs, it is reasonably clear where the foot-tap is. and i will go a step further to say that most music usually has these beats grouped together in groups of 2, 4, 8, etc. the way most music is written on paper is in groups of 4 beats, with bar lines dividing the bars (or 'measures'). most music uses 4 beats per bar. that being said it is really up to you to decide where the begining of the bars should be. but i think in most music there is a clear answer. to learn how to detect other time signatures besides 4/4, just start finding examples of them and then you will get better at hearing them. but when songs use 3-based time signatures, it can often be represented in multiple ways, many of which actually still heavily involve 4s. 2s, 3s, and 4s, are used all the time in music. it is very rare that music consistently uses a 5 or 7 pattern all the way through. usually when time signatures like 5 or 7 happen, it tends to be only once, and then goes back to 4. it is quite common for songs to need to add an extra beat or half a beat here and there, particularly at the end of the chorus or at the end of a section. this is accomplished by having 1 bar that is a different time signature. it is much more rare to have a song that entirely is based on a 5 pattern or a 7 pattern or another higher odd number. i'm not sure if that answers your question actually, but i think my most important point is that most music is in groups of 2, 4, and 8. and the way that is most commonly written on paper is with 4 beats per bar, and the time signature is called 4/4 (actually the first number is written above the second number but that's not easy to type here) the top or first number represents how many beats per bar. the bottom (or second) number is supposed to tell you what kind of a note gets the beat. so 4/4 should technically mean there are 4 beats in a bar and a 'quarter' note gets 1 beat. i realize there are holes in this system and many time signatures really can't be analyzed quite this way but that is the way the idea is supposed to work."

i was looking through the code and it is badly written(but works). just a question?,and an insult.
And if something is nothing?,nothing is nothing.
Why is the english language so weird?,"because it is a combination of many different languages and dialects. i think actually most languages are born this way, and most languages are in that sense 'weird' which is normal."
"Like how a Normal C major chord differs from those chords where you play C, F, A?",.
Thank you so much for the help! I'm having lots of fun reading the answers you give people on tips to play?,
When are you going to add subtitles to your videos?,"i would prefer to re-edit the entire video. there are words all over the screen in most of my videos, so it would be important to re-do the visual and the audio entirely."
"hey, bill, i dont even know how to properly write in english, or even speak, to be honest, but i'm really afraid i'll never succed at doing art related stuff, its something that its always on the back of my mind keeping me from doing more stuff?",everyone who has ever succeeded has had moments like that. and they moved forward anyway. just because there is dirt and mud everywhere doesn't mean you can't drive right through it on your dirt/mud bike.

You don't like Roman numerals(8.7.176:42 pm)?,.
":0 woah. What do you call a I,IV,V?","1, 4, 5 (by the way this is off the subject but if you are talking about a 4 bar chord sequence, in my opinion you really need to list all 4 bars, indicating which chord is doubled. such as 1, 1, 4, 5 or 1, 4, 5, 5. there is a huge difference depending on the timing, and if no timing is otherwise listed, just simply saying 1, 4, 5 (or I,IV,V) leaves me feeling still 100% left out of what is actually going on, with a 95% suspicion that it is actually referring to one of the two aforementioned 4-bar sequences, and being completely unable to determine which)."
what is the difference between person and human?,i think person means whatever you are. human is just what you happen to be.
all your asnwers are only one sentence long! Why_?,"they are not, but i respect your opinion."
"a professor told me a 7/13 voiced 7 1 2 3 6 was a cluster, cause of the tone to tone intervals. But it doesn't sound clustery to me?",i suppose the famous proverb applies here: one person's cluster is another person's non-cluster.
chords where I can use the whole tone scale (besides #11 and b13 chords?)?,a whole tone scale will generally work best over chords that only contain notes from that whole tone scale.
something to do with the teachers/teaching methods?,i am self taught.
do you think that rock music sounds powerful cause of the paralel fifths and octaves in power chords? Oh only now i see the irony of my question?,rock music' could mean a hundred million different things. i think it could mean even more things than there are songs to represent all those thing.
"Bill, i get that everything has its unique qualities and flaws, but don't you think some things have more unique qualities than others? (quality being something completely personal and intimate)?",i think everything surely has infinite qualities. a 'quality' sounds like something only a human could be in the mood to see.
ive noticed a big difference between the Cs. they all sound the same but some are higher the same and some are lower the same. you can even play them at the same time and they cooperate very well. next step please?,"go to the middle of the keyboard. take every white note from C to the next C. so that should be 8 notes (c, d, e, f, g, a, b, c).

"Do you set aside a block of time to work each day (ex. 9am-5pm) since this is like your job? or, since it involves a lot of creativity (which doesn't adhere to a specific timeframe) do you find yourself jumping up with inspiration and going to work right away in lots of random bursts so as to not forget something that could end up being pretty cool? sorry for my english?","there is more work to be done than could ever be done. therefore, i work as much as possible."

what is a bandicoot?,i have no idea.
do you still have a bad car?,it's worse.
how are computers random. it doesn't make any sense. they run programs that always do a thing in the same way every time but sometimes the object is to not do the same thing every time?,"i think the most basic way is to some how derive it from the time asked. for example if you put the smallest possible unit of time into mod10, and then spit out the digit (0-9) corresponding to the exact moment you requested something random, then i think that's pretty random. you really never manipulate it, unless you used another computer."

"what is the true meaning of the hi, I'm steve song? (THE 2 SONGS)?","the meaning of both songs is that putting music in a video can be nice. a hidden meaning is that music in videos is actually SO powerful that it makes the audience become attached to whatever music in the video, and demand a 'full verion' of it, regardless of how much better (and/or 'full') music i have already done without videos."

"i just. i love it when picked or plucked strings sound SOAPY. you can hear it on a bright acoustic guitar but... even more on a banjo or mandolin. there's something about the satisfying, slippery but solid texture of that sound that makes me think of soap. even dragging a pick across a string sounds like what it feels like to run your fingernail over a bar of soap. all the little stops and starts. mmmm. yummy right?","oh damn, you are special."
What the hell i'm supposed to do here ? I'm confused and that make me sad?,"read questions, ask a question, etc. that sort of thing."
do you like to surf? by surfing i mean like riding the waves of thoughts and emotions?,oh hell yeah.
"let me amend what i was worried about with the whole individuals thing. to be an individual i think is SUPER IMPORTANT AND MEANINGFUL!!!! but most of life's positions and jobs and stations are devoid of any respect for individuality. people are treated as assets, machines. i think most people just loan out their time in life as Unique people in order to have money, for living. that's AWFUL. i want to do so much, i dont want to be a machine. but am i really so different from most people? why do i deserve to escape the fate most are consigned to?","this particular world has a competitive nature to it. i don't really know why it is that way, but it is. everyone is unique. but you need to fight for your uniqueness. and also try being even more unique, and fighting even harder."
"what are your thoughts on bass guitar as an instrument, what it should contribute to a song etc?","you'll just have to try it with and without, and see for yourself."

"please do a video of got to know whats going on next!! i know, an entirely new piece would be great too and everyone would enjoy the shit out of it. i just really feel like that song needs a video. no, it deserves a video. im scared that if you do the new thing, theres not gonna be a video.im only writing this because you seem unsure of your next step. it probably won't matter in the end?","at this point, i have fully re-realized the importance of doing videos for songs. this is clearly illustrated in the fact that everyone thinks that movie star is a brand new song, everyone wants longer versions of the steve songs, and hardly anyone has heard of 'got to know what's going on.' most people never heard of movie star before the video. it is common knowledge that videos are vitally important for song publicity, and i have known this for a long time, but earlier this year i was hooked on the idea that i could do them without videos, for a simple reason which is that i can do songs about 4 times faster if i skip the video. this is a tempting strategy, but as i said i'm currently back in the viewpoint that videos are needed. what i'm trying to say is, i highly doubt that my next project will be a videoless song. it might be a new song together with a video, or it might be something completely different."
if two witches were watching two watches which witch would watch which watch?,each which would watch one watch. then they should switch.
is nine nine or is nine ten?,i will check.
what do you think of this chord progression:Eb Bb Db Ab Bmaj7?,"in order for that to have any meaning, you will need to specify the timing-- how long each of the chords last. then, you really need to specify specifically how they are voiced, which notes you used in which octave. you didn't even tell me whether it loops. that's 5 chords, so unless it's a weird time signature there must be some that are a different length. unless it does not loop in which case again you need to specify the timing. then still, you need to specify how it's played rhythmically and what kind of tone. and all that still means nothing if i don't know what the melody is, and even still, the over all effect can still be influenced by what the lyrics are. even still, with all that information written down on paper, there are still worlds of sonic factors that can give it a vastly different sounding result, even after nailing down the full notation, tempo, melody, and lyric. that being said, i think it's fine. everything is fine."
do you remember the thrill of the first time you heard/noticed a specific interval in a song? (like for instance i remember when i was little and first noticed that 7th and 9th in a final chord of a blues song)?,"i remember at a young age figuring out if youre in the key of C and youre about go to F, sneak a Bb note into the mix (in other words play C7) right before you go. it will get everyone in the room ready and eager for the trip."
why did you stop making notes at 12.17.16?,"that's not when i stopped, but why haven't you made any."
how many numbers are in the number 1000?,it depends how you look at it.
how many of the questions people ask here do you actually answer?,you wanna check.
is learning things fun?,oh hell yeah.
"If we could somehow quantify the act of being reasonable,?",which i think is completely impossible.
"I.e. if you're being completely unreasonable, you're operating at 0 Wurtz, but if you're super reasonable, that's maybe 6 Wurtz. I estimate you are at a level of about 7.9 Wurtz so I doubt we can go higher. Also it's logarithm like the Richter scale so every increment of 1 Wurtz is 10 times more reasonable than the last Wurtz (e.g. 5 Wurtz is 100 times more reasonable than 3 Wurtz)?",
"what is the true meaning of the hi, I'm steve song?",there are 2 songs in that video.
how do you overcome mediocrity?,try rotating it.
"When im in the random question page (accessed by the im feeling lucky button), there's a new random question button, but refreshing the page does the same thing. Why add a button instead of just writing somethinf like refresh for a new random question or, in bill wurtz style, ive added a button to your keyboard that serves you a new random question. Ive named it F5. Click it for a new random question?","i think your solution is nice, but much much too complicated."
"if so, what do you do againts cloudy mind?(my mind just got unclouded, today. but i dont know how i did it)?","sometimes you have to just try every type of thing, and it still doesn't work, for years and years. until one day you get so desperate that you just pull the fire alarm or something, kind of like."
"bill, are you there?",where.
"when you inevitably perform in california live will you replace one of the states (west virginia, minnesota, colorado, etc) with the name of the state you're in or do you find that too kitschy?",i've never thought about it. i would do it if the state has 3 syllables. that would be a nice challenge to try to find a way to say each location in a way that fits rhythmically.
"you often give advice to wannabee musicians to just play around, use notes and combine them in different ways and it comes across as thats how you got to where you are. But it's obvious from this page that your actual music knowledge is vast and that you didnt stick to messing around and actually took some serious time to study music and music history, get acquainted with various styles including classical and jazz and also you even revealed that you actually had some formal tutoring/training as well (7.13.17 11:58 am). Isn't it a little disingenious to just say to people to mess around with music when there's so much more to music than that? Sorry if it sounds like an accusatory question, i dont mean anything bad by it. Just feel like youre underselling how much work one has to put in to be bill wurtz or jay z or bono or whoever?","over and over and over again, people talk about learning music like it's something that someone else has to give to you, or like it's something that someone else can just make you do. that's just not how it worked for me. sure, there is a lot of language for music, like knowing the note names, even knowing what the common industry names are for chords. but that information is all out there readily available ESPECIALLY now with the internet. the only way any of that information is going to make sense is if you actually try it out. and when you are ready to learn what things are called, i think you will find that the information will be readily available. i will also readily provide that information as well. like for example, if anyone asks me what any note is called, or if anyone says is there a special name for when you play C, Eb, and G at the same time, i will readily and gladly say that's a C minor chord. but if someone asks 'how to use theory to get music to sound good', i will explain again and again and again that the way to do this, and the way to learn how to do it, is by using your own experience, your own mind, your own hands, and your own ears, otherwise you're just not going to get the good stuff. i will keep trying to explain this to people until the apocolypse, maybe even after that."
i feel like the 'ask' button should have a cool color scheme like the randy button. please do it mr. wurtz?,i prefer to keep it simple. please don't call me mr. wurtz.
describe yourself in three words?,doesn't describe self.
bill can i call you bill?,sure.
bill do you hate jews or do you love them?,what i think about a person is not affected by whether or not they are jewish.
do you like making the medium size songs and projects or do you prefer the shorter or longer ones. you're one of my inspirations?,"i'd like to make a wide range of sizes and types of items. this means i have to a lot of catching up in the medium range, because that is the range that i feel i have done the least."
"bill, i have a trick which will get you nice results!! take a background with a pattern, reverse it and put the reversed one on a different layer. change the opacity of the reversed layer to 50% and merge the 2 layers?","i already do that, but i usually prefer to do other things as well, such as change the size, angle, color, and also make them move. and use a slightly different composite algorhythm than simple opacity."
What if you are the main character of the universe?,i think every one is. and it means it's gonna be a great story.
hello what would you say is the difference in tone and your feelings when you say fuck no versus absolutely not thans?,it seems about the same.
why are you always so concerned about how you came to be?,i think i am concerned about it a medium amount of the time. but i respect your opinion.
what do i do if i love the color yellow?,"use it, and seek it out."
"how long did it take you to compose movie star? great song btw, i loved the unorthodox time signature?","the song was written and recorded in 1 week, with the writing probably taking the first 2-3 days. this does not include the chorus, which was written on a vine writing session in december 2015."
alien crickets eh? How did you make that sound? Or what are you trying to accomplish with it? Reminds me of a high organ with the leslie on fast or something?,you might be able to convince me to explain it to you if you are persistant although i don't think i can talk about it here. although 'what was i trying to accomplish' is an easy question. i was trying to make sounds to use in songs.
if oranges are orange why arnt lemons called yellows?,the color orange was named after the orange fruit. the orange fruit was not named after the color.

why were there so many snakes in your movie star video?,it's actually all the same snake.
can you please explain what graphics free title graphics are? you keep saying it but I'm not sure i understand what it is?,"it's like you want to make a title for a page, but instead of using any pictures or graphics, you have to just use text. you can use any technique you want, such as different colors, or even rearranging the letters, to make it more interesting while still not using any actual pictures."

why there is a whole section of questions about potatoes?,i think the real question is why do i get so many questions about potatoes.
what do you look like?,i will check.
why is the q green?,.
"speaking of, what is the difference between 4/4 8/8 16/16 2/2 or anything else like that?","those are all mathematically the same (like the bars will look the same on paper) but usually the second number says what kind of note gets the beat. so like, in 4/4, the quarter note is where the beat is. in 2/2 (also nicknamed cut time) the bars look exactly the same, but the half note gets the beat (you tap your foot on the half note intead of the quarter note.) the main difference would really be the tempo -- cut time (2/2) is designed for the bars to basically go twice as fast. and when you see a tempo marking on the top of the page, it will say half note = xxx b.p.m instead of quarter note = xxx b.p.m. so in cut time (2/2) the bars will usually go by twice as fast. what the point of this is exactly, i'm not sure. i think cut time was used much more 100 years ago. perhaps people were too lazy to write 16th notes and preferred to use 8th notes for the fast stuff instead. i'm not sure. 8/8 and 16/16 are really never used. time signatures ending in 8 also don't necessarily follow this rule of what note gets the beat, for example sometimes 7/8 is used when in reality the quarter note should get the beat, and the actual time signature would be 3 and a half/4 but no one says that for insanity reasons. also 6/8 is very very commonly counted as the dotted quarter note getting the beat, in which case the actual time signature would technically be 2/2.66666 which again would be completely insane to see written on the page."

"bon jovi and hey hey hey i'm kind of in a weird position where i don't know what what to do in life/don't want to go to college because i'm not really passionate about a SPECIFIC field. i paint, play the piano/cello, write, code, read and do a bunch of other crap but i honestly have no desire to go to art school, music school, or be a tech major etc. i like a lil bit of everything and honestly i'm totally fine working for the man without a degree for the rest of my life. ik how to save money and i'm planning to book it to australia asap and though that's EXTREMELY irrational and dumb i'm really ok being broke (i've been there my whole life). the problem is everybody thinks i'm dumb and batshit crazy for not caring money (what about health insurance? how are you gonna support yourself? you'll regret it) and nobody understands that money. is. paper. and i don't care. i know how to steal, food isn't a problem. i just want to help people and i don' t need m oney to do that. tbh i would fake being religious to go be a missionary in countries damaged by political trauma, natural disasters, etc. what's the point sitting on a fat stack of cash and never helping anybody out that shit is gross. am i wrong for wanting to do that? should i work to something bigger? should i tell people to piss off, or take their advice with a grain of salt? ik you'll either a.) not answer or b.) give a half assed single word/sentence answer but hey, i'm gonna stay optimistic, you seem like a cool dude and gracias if you help a sis out. salut?","it sounds like you are very strong and resilient. money does matter, and the ways people say it does matter are real. but you have also indicated that you are patient, resourceful, hard working, and responsible. it sounds like you are going to be fine. that kind of attitude is exactly what is going to free you up mentally, spiritually, and logistically, to build your life in exactly the way you are meant to. pretty soon everyone will be looking up to you and asking you how you did it."
