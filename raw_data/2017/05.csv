(referring to your jazz page)?","the reason that page is labeled jazz is because it's just opening up the book to a tune, picking a tempo (perhaps not even the original tempo!) and jamming through it with the boys. usually playing the head once through, and then improvising over the form. this activity has been called jazz. jazz can mean many different things but that's one of the things it has meant, and the title of that page is a reference to those types of sessions. as a twist, when it is used in that context it usually refers to a different instrumentation than i'm using, and it is a live jam between 4 different people. whereas i'm doing it all myself. but the activity is very much the same. especially considering that the first several dozen tunes i did were sight read from the Real Book, which has been a staple of these types of sessions."

'hey china put itself back together again,' tibet (in a lower range, it blends in with the chord), 'korea just became itself,' 'china's back yay' (it's all by itself on that one), the renaissance art montage, australia, and surely many more times."

"You seem like you're really good at being yourself, so i would like some advise. i always feel like a chameleon acting like the people i'm around it's like i have a completely different personality when i'm with different people.

(please, don't hyperlink it with the other ad-demanding ueqstions, it doesn't belong there)?","i've thought of that. but i think people get in trouble for that. also every time i think i have an idea for some clever way to monetize something, i them suddenly snap out of it and say 'no!! why do i have to do that? i am here to make the content i want to make, and post it to be viewed the way i made it!! is that so much to ask?' it's kind of like when a knife salesman insists on coming into your house, so as a compromise, he is able to convince you to let him sleep in the dog house, and not bother you. but then suddenly you snap out of it and say what!? no, how about just leave entirely."

I've always wanted to get good at piano improv but I've been intimidated by the thought of learning a buttload of scales. is there a way to learn to improvise well without having to get comfortable with how scales work first? I've never been good at learning scales because the technical side of music is a mystery to me. is there a way to learn scales through osmosis?,scales? forget that. just learn what notes you want. and don't blame me if they sound good together.

Why is there no B# or Cb?,"there is. B# means C, and Cb means B. you might use B# if you are coming up a scale like F#, G#, A#, C, C#. but you can see if we use B# instead, it looks like F#, G#, A#, B#, C# it looks a little neater because we have 1 of each letter, instead of having no B and 2 C's and have to un-sharp and re-sharp the C. same thing the other way, if you are in Gb major, you might prefer to say Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db neatly so you use all the letters in a row, instead of having to un-flat and re-flat the B by going Gb, Ab, Bb, Bnatural, Db. if you are writing on the staff, the advantage of keeping it scalar become even more clear. i hope that makes sense."

I love making funky chords on the piano and such but I also wanna know what people are talking about when they add a seventh?,"if you have a c major chord (c, e, g) adding a major 7th note means adding B, and adding a flat seventh means adding Bb. it's like if you go up a C scale (c,d,e,f,g etc) and count 1,2,3,4,5 etc, it's the 7th note. which is either B or Bb depending on what mood you're in."
or sustain a chord?,"sustaining a chord just means holding it down. like if you play a chord and don't let go. pianos also have a pedal for this, so you can play the chord and let go but if you are holding the 'sustain pedal' the chord will stay on until you lift the pedal. very handy."
and actually be able to play it or be able to work with it. I've been studying sheet music for less than a year now but I still wanna understand things.

Or am I just not able to hear the slight room verb on the sung parts because it's buried? (Again, not critiquing.

what part of hotewig took the most research/time to tl;dr down for us plebs? (whether that was learning about it or deciding to keep it in or out of the script). thanks again for condensing 11 months into 20 minutes?,"i'm not sure, but over the summer is when the research/writing happened. from about 2000bc to 1500ad i was going in 500 year blocks. i would just learn everything i could for every region, and write it all down, and then i had to basically just bang my head into a wall trying to get it to fit together. like a puzzle, and it had to make sense and it had to be interesting and it had to also be short. oh and after 2 months writing i reached the end but it was 20min45sec and still not 'good' enough, so during phase 2 (planning out the video) i actually ended up doing a lot of re-writes mainly in the second half, to basically make everything even simpler and shorter. it was a real nightmare to condense all that down. i was pretty much hallucinating all the hateful you left this out comments, in advance. but there was nothing i could do, i had to move forward."

what key is most of your songs in?,most of my songs are in different keys.
"some people are claiming that youve made jokes about rape in the latest video, with stuff like the race for africa thing; what are your thoughts?","that's not really a joke, they pretty much really did that, and it's really called the scramble for africa."
are you overwhelmed by the overwhelming response to hotewig? or were you ready for this?,"the response to history of japan was similar last year, so this year i have decided to hide under a rock. it's nice."
have you ever written a capital letter?,yes.
"although i know you understand the seriousness, why use rape in such a joking context/manner and with the knowledge that theres absolutely so many youtube edgy folk that went HAH RAPED along the unfortunately popular current usage of 'rape' as in defeating somebody or doing better than them. this tone isnt meant to be accusatory i just would like to know where you stand on this, i love your humor and the effort you put into your vids but i personally couldnt watch this last one after the first mention?","in the case of the scramble for africa, i was trying to explain it in the quickest and most efficient manner possible, and if you read up on the scramble for africa, i think you might find that that is a reasonably accurate one-word description of what happened. in the case of the rape of nanking, that is what the event is commonly known as, the 'rape of nanking.' i should also mention that i was heavily criticised last year because the rape of nanking was not mentioned the history of japan video. so i decided i should mention it in this video. i hope that makes sense. also i can't control what happens in youtube comments, unless i disable comments."

did you know you were posting history of the world right before the ap world history test? (I watched it on the way to test and took it as a sign from the gods)?,"people started to tell me about those tests in april, assuming that it would be done by then, and i assumed it would be too. then as it got closer, i almost started to get stressed in a weird way, and then i got sort of upset about being stressed because test-prep is so not the reason i do what i do. if i did that, i would just get on camera and say a bunch of facts, not spend almost a year making the craziest thing i possibly can. so as the video was approaching completion on the week of the test, i was a bit torn because i didn't want to feel like i was racing to finish it for the test. and yet i didn't want to release it the day after the test either. it was very confusing and strange. the test was a very strange thing to think about, and it was very important to remember that that is not the reason i did it."
"how much history did you have to learn to make a history of the entire world, i guess?",probably about 5 times as much as is in the video.
why do you use this font?,i don't use any font. the font you are seeing here is the font your browser chooses to use when there is no font assigned.
how do you do stuff with things?,i try to just get some things and do the stuff. if that doesn't work try doing it sideways.
Why don't you have ads on your videos? I mean for the longer ones. You deserve the extra revenue for all your hard work on your HOTWIG video?,"revenue is good, but renting my audience to advertisers is a sacrifice i am not interested in making. it kind of defeats the whole point of what i'm doing."
How come you don't have ads on the vid? U couldmake so much money?,"the money would be lucrative, but renting my audience to advertisers is a sacrifice i am not interested in making. it kind of defeats the whole point of what i'm doing."

how do i get a job in advertising after applying over 700+ times?,"i think you will have much better success if you apply to 700 jobs, instead of applying 700 times to 1 job."
are you working on a song now?,oh hell yeah.
why does 'car' show up often in your songs? like 9 different times?,"i think you will find that it has been showing up a lot in popular music in general for at least the past 50 years. it is just a fun easy word to say, and a fun mode of transportation. too bad the fuel makes such a mess."
"at 5.11.17  5:12 am, does that mean that you wont make 19 second videos or 8.2834729304 second videos ever again?","i need to catch up on medium lengths projects first, until i no longer feel like they have been hopelessly neglected."
"hi bill, i really respect your work. keep on keepin' on. question: do you think public transportation has a big impact on society outside of trains and airlines? love you. ser?na?","yes, particularly busses."

Uh hi you forgot brexit in that video on the history of the world but other than that you did well kthxbye?,"i did not forget brexit, i decided it would be irresponsible to mention brexit because what if the entire EU collapses next year. then it will look pretty silly to only mention brexit, when brexit is really a small piece of a larger story."

(I'd be totally cool with that, but I'm running it by you first.)?","i don't think you need to try to have opinions. opinions are fine, but they are not something you want to necessarily aim for. this world is a very intricate mix of different elements, all flying in different directions. it's nice to take it all in together."

B, C#, G, F# are really the notes that we're working with here. also A could be buried in there somewhere but with the harmonica on A# you can't tell. and D# in the bass of course. sounds like a pretty standard D#aug7 (in the key of G#min) with all the usual suspects that you would find in a stevie sort of world."
how big is your cucumber?,i don't have any cucumbers.
Is Lenin in the new video?,he was already in an instagram.
