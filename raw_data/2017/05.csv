"if you dont know if something is jazz when listening to it, then how do you know something is jazz when you are performing it? (referring to your jazz page)?","the reason that page is labeled jazz is because it's just opening up the book to a tune, picking a tempo (perhaps not even the original tempo!) and jamming through it with the boys. usually playing the head once through, and then improvising over the form. this activity has been called jazz. jazz can mean many different things but that's one of the things it has meant, and the title of that page is a reference to those types of sessions. as a twist, when it is used in that context it usually refers to a different instrumentation than i'm using, and it is a live jam between 4 different people. whereas i'm doing it all myself. but the activity is very much the same. especially considering that the first several dozen tunes i did were sight read from the Real Book, which has been a staple of these types of sessions."

"so you've started out doing writing, and then turned that into videos/songs wich you've uploaded.but why did you start out with the short videos?was it to keep order or because it was easier?","it's always easier to start small. i hear from people every day saying they can't figure out how to follow through on a large project. the answer is to do shorter projects for a while. they get done, and you learn more and more tricks, really quickly. it's like building a house. you're never gonna build a large house by yourself on the first try."

I responded that I could teach music/music theory to the kids. Then she was like, Awesome. That'll be a great experience for them. But what's the practical use of music theory? Like in actual school. And... I did not know what she meant or how to answer. I just murmured something about rhythm and math or something. So my question: How would you answer that? Is music theory a good thing for non-musicians to just learn?",music theory can be any way you have of understanding the music you are playing. the theory might be totally different depending on which music your playing. i'm not sure if that answers your question.
I really want to learn a musical instrument because I love to write songs/poems but I kind of have no knowledge of theory and it seems kind of hard to learn. atm im self teaching myself to play the harmonica kind of for the theory as they are cheap and I don't want to spend loads of money on an instrument that I might give up in a few months.Any advice? (and thanks for bothering to read/answer)?,harmonica might not work as your only instrument if you are doing music with lyrics. it is very hard to play harmonica and sing at the same time. maybe even impossible.

"Do you ever think about how bacteria are just made of chemistry and reactions but like really smart chemistry that doesn't have to just bump into other molecules randomly?So some weird stuff happened first that no one really knows (maybe it was like an enzyme molecule thing that catalysed a reaction in which another enzyme molecule is made so the more of the substrate it gets to go via it's reaction pathway, the more enzyme there is and then the more it can get substrate and then..)  and then one day you suddenly have these bacteria things that are basically mini robots that are programmed to drive to things they can react with - kitted out with state of the art reaction driving and maximising equipment. But they don't choose where they go they just get dragged around by chemotaxis.But then chemotaxis gets really really complicated and the mini robots team up into little groups of robots (by accident) to make eukaryotes and these basically become ultra amazing jellyfish robots and it gets kinda hard to start to see where they're just getting dragged around by chemotaxis and where they're making decisions i mean could you call an insect's behaviour decisions? Then some filler and thanks to some handy processes like evolution and natural selection we get the next gen. supercomputer chemistry that can think and work with other supercomputers to keep doing what it's always done without ever really realising it. Because there was no such thing as realising something. And then the more they work together the smarter they get and eventually the chemistry based supercomputers learn what chemistry is. And then it's weird because the chemical system on a passive level is incredible at chemistry with a super fine tuned system but actively doesn't even understand what chemistry is and is kind of shit at it.  So we're kind of chemistry doing chemistry because it means it doesn't have to deal with random stuff on an even better level and it beats entropy even more extravagantly than it did before - using the passive system, that took billions of years to develop by chance, to move individual atoms and make structures like laptops and abstract  structu res like music that are too statistically unlikely and should never exist but if you go the long way around to making them by starting with bacteria they do.So I'm just a chemical system that become sentient? Is that supposed to mean something? I guess you could even say chemistry had to be made too from more fundamental stuff. Will AI be like the next level after us? cos it's still chemistry just kinda like it realised what it was and instead of waiting for evolution built a better, faster, smarter vessel for itself. If it wants - if we want.So the universe went from having no purpose and just random stuff to having a purpose. Because we want things does that count as purpose?Idk kinda rambley.","i'm not sure, but once you figure out consciousness, it seems to be a runaway train from there. and there is no reason to turn back, and i don't think anyone ever has."

Thanks!","the jingles were written in exact detail during the writing process, which includes the exact script, and the exact jingles. jingles are something i can use at any time, and usually if i need to say something boring and i can't think of a way to make it interesting, music might be a good option."
"Hey, it's me, person watching your videos everyday. So, I'm wondering, why did you bring up the sultan of Oman living in Zanzibar? It's pretty funny but seems unrelated to everything else. One of my favourite things about the video is how you make history into an interrelated narrative in which everything mentioned is important. But the Sultan thing seems super random. Thanks!","there are hundreds, thousands of things that happened in world history, so needless to say it was an insane challenge to figure out what to include and what to cut, and a never ending impossible balancing act. to help stay upbeat and sane in this project, i found it important early on to keep a very light and free attitude about the whole thing. people are surely going to get on my case for 'not mentioning this' and 'not mentioning that,' you can't mention everything that ever happened in one video. so the only way to really keep my shit together was just remember that this is a crazy thing to attempt, so just keep it fun, and don't be afraid to include weird things on purpose, just as a reminder that this is supposed to be fun, to hopefully distract from the fact that it is impossible to actually mention everything. the oman jingle was written in an early draft, and then got cut along with a million other things, but i liked the jingle so much i brought it back. trying to keep the whole thing perfectly balanced with an equal amount of details everywhere is kind of like drawing a straight line in a hurricane. at some point you have to just accept that certain random things are going to have extra details. also once a bit is written and turns out good, it can be hard to let go of. other examples would include the chandragupta/seleucis elephant deal, the robespierre stuff, etc. i had a hundred years war bit that i liked so much i was so sad to cut it, but there was surely already way too much britain/france in the video, and the first thing people usually complain about in history videos is that there's too much europe. so i had to cut it."

"Is this next song you're working on like: da, da, da-DA-DA-da dah da da! Or more like: mmm-hmm-hmmmm mmmm ?",more like in california you can smoke marijuana.
do you think chips will still sponsor you after coming out as anti-ad?,i have never been sponsored by anyone.
What part of hotewig did you use the emotional Zawinul for?,"i used it a lot. it is a mid-range lead sound. it is used on  'grab stuff at the same time' probably that high blip on 'dinosaurs,' 'better farming was just invented,' 'oh look it must be the (mycenaean) greeks,' 'ah the greeks just had the idea...' 'hey china put itself back together again,' tibet (in a lower range, it blends in with the chord), 'korea just became itself,' 'china's back yay' (it's all by itself on that one), the renaissance art montage, australia, and surely many more times."

So if i'm trying to be myself should i be a chameleon because that is myself or should i try to be me. if the second how do i do that.

Why does i'm a diamond start with four bars of boxes taste like mush? Does it mean anything?,"without that, the next part would never have existed. it's kind of like being thirsty. being thirsty is lousy and a real drag, but that's what makes the water taste so good when it arrives."
"do you think you will shut out input from your fans if this questions page gets too insane, or do you always want to make sure there's a way for people to reach you?","it has steadily become more insane, over time, and i have made the necessary adjustments, over time. i hope to keep doing it as long as possible."

Like I understand that you wouldn't want to go super recent like covering the Arab Spring or events in Syria, but events in Iraq and things such as the Iranian Revolution are seemingly important things to world history you never covered.

"i have an idea! make a jingle video saying this video contains ads or something and allow ads to be displayed on it. just this one video. this way people who dislike seeing ads will not have to encounter them and people who keep demanding ads can support you this way. actually you know what, don't even put a jingle in there, that would be unfair for those who wouldn't watch it. just make it a few seconds of black screen, maybe with a text saying thanks for your support at the end. what do you think? (please, don't hyperlink it with the other ad-demanding ueqstions, it doesn't belong there)?","i've thought of that. but i think people get in trouble for that. also every time i think i have an idea for some clever way to monetize something, i them suddenly snap out of it and say 'no!! why do i have to do that? i am here to make the content i want to make, and post it to be viewed the way i made it!! is that so much to ask?' it's kind of like when a knife salesman insists on coming into your house, so as a compromise, he is able to convince you to let him sleep in the dog house, and not bother you. but then suddenly you snap out of it and say what!? no, how about just leave entirely."

"hey, how do i get over my bad singing? i play guitar, compose on the computer and dabble in piano but my voice is shit. i realized that very few people actually care about the techincal side of a composition so they only appreciate the singing. and since my singing is bad im sad.","for now, you can write in a way that plays to your personality, and strengths. if you write the right thing you might not even have to 'sing'. you can just use your voice and be yourself in whatever way you most feel comfortable. with musical skill, you can make anything seem great. also the more you use your voice the more you will automatically get better. so you might as well use it for recording the songs you write. just do it. you'll get better. it's gonna be fine."
are you providing sneek peeks to your upcoming creations?,oh hell yeah.

how do you harmonize people talking like in your video harmonizing the weather lady?,"first find the melody. (a lot of speech is really slurred between notes, so you just have to decide what to say the notes are.) then just go in and find chords that make it sound like music! it's like if you see a drawing with only the characters but not the environment/background. you get to make up what the environment is. it's fun and crazy."
"hey bill this question im about to ask is very important to me because i struggle with lack of productivity? how do you stay so productive? i was convinced that you were procrastinating on HOTEWIG but you were actually making it as fast as you can all year, while also probably working a normal job (idk ur financial situation). also, some videos of yours indicate that you can be lazy (i dont wanna clean my room),?","that song was fictional. but even if it's true, if you think about it, it's a sign of my productivity. because at that time i was spending all my time working on history of japan, to have it done as soon as possible."
but still you overcome it and are productive? How? Is it just a matter of finding what you want to do most in life? Any tips? thabks!,i guess it just depends on how bad you want to have the thing done.

I've always wanted to get good at piano improv but I've been intimidated by the thought of learning a buttload of scales. is there a way to learn to improvise well without having to get comfortable with how scales work first?

Why is there no B# or Cb?,"there is. B# means C, and Cb means B. you might use B# if you are coming up a scale like F#, G#, A#, C, C#. but you can see if we use B# instead, it looks like F#, G#, A#, B#, C# it looks a little neater because we have 1 of each letter, instead of having no B and 2 C's and have to un-sharp and re-sharp the C. same thing the other way, if you are in Gb major, you might prefer to say Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db neatly so you use all the letters in a row, instead of having to un-flat and re-flat the B by going Gb, Ab, Bb, Bnatural, Db. if you are writing on the staff, the advantage of keeping it scalar become even more clear. i hope that makes sense."

or sustain a chord?,"sustaining a chord just means holding it down. like if you play a chord and don't let go. pianos also have a pedal for this, so you can play the chord and let go but if you are holding the 'sustain pedal' the chord will stay on until you lift the pedal. very handy."

Sorry about this not being a question I hope you dont mind. To compensate, right after submitting this comment, Ill ask a question.","ah, that's actually a really good reason. here's my reasoning: i never had an icon or a logo when i made the website. the website was made before the youtube or any of those other channels. i originally wasn't going to use other sites. but i sort of got pressured into it. and all those sites are designed for you to have a profile image, so i had to come up with something. so i never really wanted to use the umbrella, i didn't want to use anything. i just came up with it because i had to use something, and that seemed the most reasonable out of all the options i had. so to use the umbrella on this site seems kind of like taking a step backwards somehow. i would possibly consider doing a favicon but i don't know yet what it would be."

Decided to focus solely on the score without quoting lines or singing along to jingles (the new arrivals one and the Turkey one almost got me).The question: How did you get so skilled in matching sounds to visual actions? The sounds you pick for zooming, panning, an empire expanding, a picture getting smaller, even an arrow being drawn are so precise and perfect every time. Have you always just heard sounds accompanying non-auditory actions in your head? Or did you learn it from somewhere like watching cartoons, for example, which tend to do that a lot?",just experience. i've been underscoring all my videos for as long as i've been making videos. it's kind of a secret weapon to make people think what they're seeing is more interesting than it actually is. that is the power of music.

"maybe it's the steady quarter note bassline paired with the rollicking drums, or the way the chords resolve super cleanly and standardly, i'm not sure, but new canaan always gives me this air of traveling that isn't quite as present in your other songs? what i was wondering though is, do the other three songs written in a similar manner follow those listed tropes (conversely, do they have a similar feel to them)? very vague question, i'm sorry, but new canaan is one of my fav songs of all time and i'm really excited to hear more songs written in a similar vein! thank you!",i think the traveling feeling is in the writing. and a large percentage of my writing in 2009 (especially spring/summer 2009) had that feel.

what part of hotewig took the most research/time to tl;dr down for us plebs? (whether that was learning about it or deciding to keep it in or out of the script). thanks again for condensing 11 months into 20 minutes?,"i'm not sure, but over the summer is when the research/writing happened. from about 2000bc to 1500ad i was going in 500 year blocks. i would just learn everything i could for every region, and write it all down, and then i had to basically just bang my head into a wall trying to get it to fit together. like a puzzle, and it had to make sense and it had to be interesting and it had to also be short. oh and after 2 months writing i reached the end but it was 20min45sec and still not 'good' enough, so during phase 2 (planning out the video) i actually ended up doing a lot of re-writes mainly in the second half, to basically make everything even simpler and shorter. it was a real nightmare to condense all that down. i was pretty much hallucinating all the hateful you left this out comments, in advance. but there was nothing i could do, i had to move forward."

are you uploading regularly now that history of the world's finished?,"i will continue working on content non-stop, just as i have for the last several years. and uploading the finished content to the appropriate place(s) immediately when it's done. i'm not sure if that answers your question."

have you ever written a capital letter?,yes.
"now that you've done the history of the world, what can you do to get people exited?",something completely different.
"although i know you understand the seriousness, why use rape in such a joking context/manner and with the knowledge that theres absolutely so many youtube edgy folk that went HAH RAPED along the unfortunately popular current usage of 'rape' as in defeating somebody or doing better than them. this tone isnt meant to be accusatory i just would like to know where you stand on this, i love your humor and the effort you put into your vids but i personally couldnt watch this last one after the first mention?","in the case of the scramble for africa, i was trying to explain it in the quickest and most efficient manner possible, and if you read up on the scramble for africa, i think you might find that that is a reasonably accurate one-word description of what happened. in the case of the rape of nanking, that is what the event is commonly known as, the 'rape of nanking.' i should also mention that i was heavily criticised last year because the rape of nanking was not mentioned the history of japan video. so i decided i should mention it in this video. i hope that makes sense. also i can't control what happens in youtube comments, unless i disable comments."

What made you want to start making videos?,
What's one part of HOTEWIG that you found particularly interesting/fascinating during your research?,"the chandragupta coincidence. more specifically, the fact that the entire internet readily will provide you information about both chandraguptas, but no one ever admits that the other exists. except one guy on a blog i found that said 'hey isnt it wild that there were 2 chandra guptas, unrelated, who founded an empire in india around the year 320 (AD or BC)'."
when you were on your daily vine schedule in late 2015 did you record a bunch of jingles in one go or split chunks up over multiple days?,"i recorded them all the day they were released. but the writing was sometimes done in advance, i would do writing sessions and write a bunch of them, and then each day i would either choose one from the list or if nothing seemed right i could write a new one."
Are you planning on doing a collab or something in the future?,
"Why did you choose to cover entire world, rather than the earth?","well the video is mainly about this planet, because that's where most of our world is. but i figured i should at least briefly explain how it got here sort of."

Did you get anything wrong in your new video that you wish you could change or was it all correct?,"apparently the label for the king of france was the wrong number. surely many other things. but doing a world history video in 20 minutes is risky business and should not be attempted, so it is important to remember that it is mainly a thrill seeking activity. i realized about halfway through the project that i actually hope there are small mistakes in there, for good luck. because the point is not that i actually said everything perfectly, because that would be completely impossible with a video of this scope. the point is that i made the attempt, and that it's a wild ride."

why does it seem like you hate yourself for everything you've done in the video?,i can only guess why it seems that way to you. i have no guesses actually.

Advice for someone picking up an instrument again after 3 years of neglect?,play it! after you pick it up.
Do you think the soul is a religious thing or simply a chemical reaction?,i think it's more patterns than chemicals.
did you know you were posting history of the world right before the ap world history test? (I watched it on the way to test and took it as a sign from the gods)?,"people started to tell me about those tests in april, assuming that it would be done by then, and i assumed it would be too. then as it got closer, i almost started to get stressed in a weird way, and then i got sort of upset about being stressed because test-prep is so not the reason i do what i do. if i did that, i would just get on camera and say a bunch of facts, not spend almost a year making the craziest thing i possibly can. so as the video was approaching completion on the week of the test, i was a bit torn because i didn't want to feel like i was racing to finish it for the test. and yet i didn't want to release it the day after the test either. it was very confusing and strange. the test was a very strange thing to think about, and it was very important to remember that that is not the reason i did it."
"Do you like making the smaller videos or the larger, histories of ___ more?",right now i am most exciting about catching up on things of a more medium size.

Do you answer all of your questions?,
"what part of the video of History of the Entire World, i guess did you get stuck on? For example, it was very difficult and you couldn't move forward for a while.","i got stuck many, many, many different times. writing it was like a puzzle. even after learning all the crap then you have to figure out how to fit it together and make it make sense and also be good and also be short enough to actually make the thing in one human lifetime. huge nightmare. also knowing that people will surely think i did something wrong when i can't actually mention everything that happened ever. very strange."
Why don't you have ads on your videos? I mean for the longer ones. You deserve the extra revenue for all your hard work on your HOTWIG video?,"revenue is good, but renting my audience to advertisers is a sacrifice i am not interested in making. it kind of defeats the whole point of what i'm doing."
You single and ready to mingle? Or just single and alone. And sad?,i am mingling in the best way i know how.
Are you okay with all of people that are so narrow-minded and selfish in their inability to understand how it wasn't possible for you to fit literally every single aspect of our world in a finite amount of time?,"yes, that is reasonable."
How come you don't have ads on the vid? U couldmake so much money?,"the money would be lucrative, but renting my audience to advertisers is a sacrifice i am not interested in making. it kind of defeats the whole point of what i'm doing."
what even motivated you to finish the history of the entire world video if you're not getting paid?,because i thought it would be awesome. also i am getting paid but that's not why i did it.

"you said the video would be 19 minutes and 23 seconds long, but it came out as 19 minutes and 26 seconds. what was added to make the length 3 seconds longer?","a little extra space at the end, because sometimes youtube videos get cut off at the end. also the run time is only 19:25, the youtube preview icon usually displays videos as 1 second longer than they are. also i might have cut the ending music a bit later than i was previously cutting it."
why r ur videos well made but ur website straight outta 2003?,i have tried to make it in a way that i think is good. i'm not sure if that answers your question.

If they tell you to shut up or if they leave, find someone else to try the method on.The only problem is it relies on someone being available, and coming up with a good ______ you can both talk about.What do you think?",that method seems all wrong for me.

"In any case, could we get a glimpse of a written song?","i have posted many of the charts on the site, especially ones from around 2010. but these would not include any updates made during the massive updating finishing sessions i did in 2012-2013, or after. from then on, i have basically transitioned into writing on the computer, using a combination of text files and small memo recordings to demonstrate the song. it's just faster and easier to store and access. i have also never posted a chart for a song that is unreleased."

"a common piece of advice given to people writing an essay is to change the font and then reread it, because it makes you actually read it instead of just looking at the parts that you always look at. do you also do something to recontextualize the video viewing when you're checking for errors? like maybe watch in different locations, using a different screen or different speakers, or putting some distortion over the audio or inverting the video or something?","ah, all those are great ideas. for music, i do tests on different speakers and headphones, and i will do that for this video as well. watching it on different screens is a great idea but i don't think i have anything available to me. all those tricks are great tricks, i should try some of them."

"When people ask if you're going to make videos for your next songs, I suspect that most of them mean are they going on YouTube in any form, not are you going to make a music video out of them. At least that's how I see them.","actually not that many people ask this at all. although i ask myself that all the time, and it's a very important question. if i skip the video, i can make way more songs, and i have already written hundreds, so it has always been extremely tempting to skip the video. but the video is extremely valuable because it massively helps deliver the song."
"That being said, are you going to upload them to YouTube once they're done? Maybe in that spinning record format that i can play or the road use?",yes i might do title videos for songs without videos. i am not sure exactly what configuration to do this. the one thing that is guaranteed is that the songs will go to the music stores.

I have honestly been regularly visiting your instagram and youtube quite regularly for the past few months AND I CAN'T WAIT ANYMORE PLS GIVE US THE VIDEO.","i will finish it first. i think it's better to finish it before posting it instead of trying to finish it after it is posted. on some sites that is challenging, or maybe even impossible."
"I know you are doing your best and working at the most efficient manner possible. Sorry that my question came out rude, but be sure that I'll be one of the first to watch and like your video!",
"I think I understand why some people think you are waiting around to upload the video as if it isn't done. it is because on your instagram picture with the plan for HOTEWIG, you say the last thing you will do before uploading is drop crazy hints. by a sort of literal interpretation of thay, it must seem to some that you are done now and dropping crazy hints before uploading?",i think the dates shown for on the history of japan progress report do overlap in some cases.

how is making videos out of your journal equivalent to putting your career on hold?,last time it took 3 months. everyone thought i was dead.

Do you just put things there you don't want to answer?,"usually it's when people just name a thing with a question mark. or maybe 2 things, but don't specify what they would like to know about those 2 things. for example, if someone said 'is the sky blue' i could perhaps try to evaluate whether it is blue. but if they just say the sky i'm left empty handed. if they are pointing to a picture, and they say the sky? then i can try to evaluate whether the picture is a picture of the sky. but if they do it with no picture, i'm stuck. if it's 2 things, like if they say the sky or the ground and they show me a picture, then i can assume they want me to figure out whether the picture is a picture of the sky or the ground, or neither. but again if they do it with no picture i'm sorry i really don't understand what's going on."

Is it okay if I have a job making music for other people?,yes.
Shouldn't my goal be making music for myself?,"yes. there is a secret twist, which is that you can do both and keep them separate. kind of like getting a non-music job and keeping it separate, except your non-music job happens to take advantage of your music skills, even though it has nothing to do with your 'real' path. you may be surprised at how well this works. again, if you feel your own path is too important to be compromised, i am telling you there is a secret twist that you can keep them separate. i know it sounds crazy and i actually didn't expect it to work so well."

i get this thing where i try recording a song (whilst writing it) but i keep just listening to the part i made because i don't know how i should move forward. and i'll listen to it up to the point at that i don't like it anymore. any thoughts and/or tips for moving forward?,"after experimenting both ways, i firmly believe that i can get much better results if i finish writing the song entirely before recording it. not micro-managing all the instruments choices and parts, but just the melody/chords and other core details, and most importantly the entire road map, beginning to end. do not leave any sections in question. in the studio you are free to have much more fun with sound choices etc if you don't have to worry about where the song goes next, if that's already planned out. this is just in my experience. some people thrive on writing in the studio. i have tried both ways and nowadays i firmly believe that what works best for me is to write to the end first, before even touching the recording."

"why is it that an ensemble with many instruments in the high range can often sound great, but having more than one bass player is often disastrous?","the harmonic series is really like a tree. the branches get smaller as they go up, so there can be more of them. but 2 trunks would really never work. play 3rds on a piano starting from around middle C, and get lower and lower. you will hear them stop working at a certain point. this will be about 1 octave above the point where 5ths would stop working, and it would be about 2 octaves above the point where single notes stop working, which is usually the end of the instrument (like around low A on piano, or in my opinion B or C) i've found that the harmonic series actually illustrates this exactly. you'll see thirds appear 2 octaves above the source note. so in otherwords if you play thirds in a certain range, the amount of 'mess' it makes is equal to the amount of 'mess' it would make if you played 5ths an octave below that. or a single note 2 octaves below. that's why heavy guitar riffs often use 5ths, and the bass usually plays the same thing 1 octave below, but in a single note. if you try to play 5ths there it just sounds like an earthquake. another interesting way of illustrating this is if you put distortion on and play 5ths, it often sounds exactly like a single note, 1 octave down. it even works if you play 4ths with distortion. it often sounds like a single note 2 octaves below the highest note. again agreeing with the harmonic series that your 2 notes are a part of."
Why are things clearer in hindsight?,because now you have additional knowledge of what used to be the future.
"hey bill, how's lief? just like you i also realise i won't live forever and therefore i want to spend as much time as possible to reaching my goals, which is make a lot of cool art and learn everything. but i don't know how to do this because i have to work 5 days a week or else i will die a lot sooner and have even less time to work on my goals. any ideas to on tricking the system?","you just have to work with the amount of time you have. regardless of the amount of time you have, the amount will still be somewhere between zero and infinity, which is exactly the right amount of time for this game to be fun and challenging and also a total nightmare."

"When people say you haven't made a video in a while and you answer Not true, I've been making a video all this time, do you understand that they mean uploaded a video?",i wonder if they even understand that i have to make the video. or if they think it just appears there when i click 'upload'.

I only ask because I started doing something similar a year ago and I've thought that for all of it. Is there any advice you can give other than wait until you can't take it any longer?,"there are plenty of things you can do, and try. i was never totally frozen, but almost everything i did felt like some kind of test or learning experiment. also did a lot of analysis, and just a lot of listening to music and watching things as well, just taking it all in and pretty much getting my mind blown all the time, and learning new things, which didn't help stop my own ideas and goals from constantly exploding bigger and broader. you might argue that 2009 was when i said 'i can't take it anymore' and started writing like crazy. but it was all writing and almost no recording. then i gradually inched my way into recording in about 2010, but then started writing 10 times more. basically i ended up leading myself into a place where i felt like i had already done centuries worth of work, but yet none of it was finalized or realized. there were many different times where you might say it 'all started' but each one was just another step. i'm not sure if that answers your question."

bill i think the speed of light is absolute by Einstein's special relativity. but all that stuff is confusing so idk?,it's tough for the characters in a story to figure out how the story is being written. but who knows maybe they can.
wat is this chord at 3:34 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fji493S90go?,"it really seems to be just D#aug7#9. i don't think the notes are written right, certainly Dnat is not in it, although it looks like that note is written in the chart. also C natural appears to be written but i don't think is actually in it, that would be a disaster. B, C#, G, F# are really the notes that we're working with here. also A could be buried in there somewhere but with the harmonica on A# you can't tell. and D# in the bass of course. sounds like a pretty standard D#aug7 (in the key of G#min) with all the usual suspects that you would find in a stevie sort of world."
