"another question about you posting the n-word. obliviously you posted it for people to see it (you smart ass...) what i mean is why did you think it was important for people to see that? i ask because it came off as a bit insensitive... anyone can easily misinterpret that as you being racist or something... i didn't wanna assume the worst though, so i asked. my guess is you posted it to show the irony/insanity behind someone sending a word like that to you, a white guy, but again, i don't wanna assume i know what you think... (although i guess i'm already kinda doing that hm)?","i didn't 'post the n-word' someone sent it to me as a 1 word question. i did not answer it, i have no answer for that. but instead of keeping it a secret and letting it make me feel strange, i decided to post it, so i can share the strangeness that i have to go through, as the operator of this questions page. i hope that makes sense."

"to the person who asked about death being necessary: death by ageing is caused by deterioration of the telomeres that cap chromosomes, which means that eventually the cells aren't able to divide anymore, so they die. it's called cell senescence (and some cells like rat brain cells don't have this problem and they can keep on dividing forever). so it is possible that in the future we could maybe prevent death, by altering DNA so that the telomeres don't go bad. (telomeres shorten after each cell replication). I don't know if you'll post this but I think it's cool info that people don't hear about unless they search for it specifically?",

According to a video you put on YouTube in December 29th 2013 you hibernated on November 19th 2015 or were planning to at the time. Did you actually hibernate or what?- Mr. Freak?,"ah, right. that song was written and recorded in 2010, audio only with no video. the video was made in 2013 and i thought it would be a cool idea for the video if i show a calendar date. i picked a date far far in the future that i thought would never arrive. i never had plans of hibernating, the song is fictional. i had no idea what i would be doing on nov 19, 2015, that was a randomly selected date. it turns out i would be working on history of japan. while also trying to do vines every day, at the same time. certainly did not hibernate although i may have wanted to."
you haven't updated the hotewig page for 5 days. are you ok?,"i am fine. updating that page is not really a huge priority, because hardly anyone is reading it. i am busy doing a huge video. there are usually many questions per day relating to the video, and it takes time to go through and copy them over. not that important, considering the page is kind of a secret page anyway. i usually update it whenever someone asks for a link to the page, so that it's updated when they link to it."
why you never answer my questions?,
"has anyone on this page ever asked you a question that's a reference to your work in some way, and you didn't realize it until well after you answered/skipped the question?",i think so.
Will you love me pls?,
what is the real next video?,"it depends if you mean the one i have been working on for the past 8 months, or the one after that. both of which will be real."

do you read books. if so what is your favourite book?,
"why was history of japan enough practice at doing long crazy documentaries, enough so that you could take this huge massive leap you are taking in scope of the project? i hope this question make sense i dont think it does?","because the process for history of japan went totally smoothly and successfully on the first try. the reason for this is because i had so much practice making shorter videos. the leap from japan to this video is large, but not as big as the leap from short videos to the japan video."

Do you ever let other people in on your creative process?,no.

are you a question?,"yes, and answers. everyone is questions and answers."
is there a specific song you want to make the first of the weekly/bi-weekly songs you release?,"no. picking songs has always been very strange for me. i can never decide whether to use randomization or not.  looking forward to getting that sorted out, and it will be more exciting this time because i am including new writing in the process."
"is it okay to complain if you think the complaining is properly justified, and also involves money, and is politely done?",oh hell yeah.

how can you describe your music? i want to get your sound but I don't know where to start?,"music is already in audio form so i don't think it's ever necessary to describe music, unless the person you are describing it to is some how unable to hear the music. i hope that makes sense."
did it take you a long time to learn video editing?,when i first started i already knew something. and now i still don't know everything. i'm not sure if that answers your question.
bill i hope you realise that you are about to upload what will become a very popular video. it will become the thing of legends?,that would be cool but there is really no guarantee of that.
