"This is going to seem like a really weird musical question, but I'm hoping to get some advice on Trills. Usually, I follow the same kinda mindset as you've said before of trying to fit the chord/instrumentation that supports the melody/song at the time (I think, it's been a while!) But I haven't been able to ever make a trill on either a brass instrument or a piano or keyboard to sound anything but really really jarring against the rest of the song... In your song this is a song for my next album you end the song with a really excellent trill on a keyboard that just Feels So Natural to the rest of the track! I absolutely know that I should be looking to find the instrumentation that supports the track as best as possible rather than Trying To Fit something that doesn't belong (as like forcing yourself to shoehorn a particular chord) but I feel like at this point there's just something that I'm fundamentally missing with my execution of a trill that always leads to it clashing Every Time. Any ideas on what might be my issue, or any tips that might help point me in the right direction? Thanks!","if i could hear an example of one of your attempts at a trill, i can try to evaluate what the problem might be."

At first I will be trying to find ideas to advance the project but I then begin to think of other art-ish things that have little or no relation to the project I am currently working on (like going from writing a poem to thinking of musical riffs).

Use a voice memo app (most phones have them) and be quick and professional about how you frame it. establish where the root of the key is, establish where the time is, and correctly count it off, so there is no confusion about where the key and time are oriented. any hints about the groove or tempo are also very helpful, (perhaps compare it to another song's tempo, if that helps) and any other hints about how the idea is oriented in the song ('this is the top of of the chorus' or 'this would the the end title line of a chorus' or 'this would be a verse line' or any other hints you can think of). and if there are any specific chord things, mention that too, like if you know the whole thing starts on the 4 chord, or something like that. but most importantly remember to orient the key (sing a quick do re mi reference or something) and properly count off the time, and sing the thing, preferably a couple of times. overall your total demo &plus; description should be about 15 to 20 seconds."

"another question about you posting the n-word. obliviously you posted it for people to see it (you smart ass...) what i mean is why did you think it was important for people to see that? i ask because it came off as a bit insensitive... anyone can easily misinterpret that as you being racist or something... i didn't wanna assume the worst though, so i asked. my guess is you posted it to show the irony/insanity behind someone sending a word like that to you, a white guy, but again, i don't wanna assume i know what you think... (although i guess i'm already kinda doing that hm)?","i didn't 'post the n-word' someone sent it to me as a 1 word question. i did not answer it, i have no answer for that. but instead of keeping it a secret and letting it make me feel strange, i decided to post it, so i can share the strangeness that i have to go through, as the operator of this questions page. i hope that makes sense."

I wrote a bunch of songs but they suck. How can I improve them?,"don't do that now. just write more. improving already written songs is a bit more advanced, i think it is more important that you push forward and write many more songs now. you will start to get better, and it will be helpful to Not plan on improving them, because that will give you confidence to move forward without constantly questioning everything. After about 100 songs, if you are still alive, then you can start going back and improving some of them, and by then i think you will have much broader experience of what works and what doesn't, and you will be much better able to hunt down the right solutions for each unique song. improving songs is a tricky game, every song is like a sick baby with its own special disease."

Is esdfghjdsxfghuiodxcfgvhjidxfgvjkdfxghujidfxghijodfxcgyuh a question?,"if you want to use it as a question, you might need to use a ? mark in order for it to be clear that it's question. not all questions need ? marks, because sometimes it is obvious based on the words, but that word alone is not necessarily a question. a ? mark would guarantee that it is interpreted as a question, regardless of whether anyone knows what it means. i hope that makes sense."

"I see a lot of questions asking when is the next history of video.  But the real question is, do you feel pressured to please the people who are constantly berating you, trying to find out when the video is coming out?","there is pressure from all sides. some people want the video to come out sooner. some people want me to work less, and 'take vacations.' some people want me to give opinions about the latest films and tv shows. some people want me to make more short videos. some people want me to make songs. some people want me to make more journal clips. some people want me to answer more questions. some people think i answer too many questions. some people want me to collaborate with their favorite artists. some people want me to make videos for their business. these are some of the many kinds of pressure i receive on a daily basis."
"Or do you not care what others think, and care only to work at a pace that suits you?  Or perhaps a combination of both?","but the only kind of pressure i pay attention to is the pressure that was present before any of those, which is whoops i have no social life but my mind has been exploding for as long as i can remember, and it needs to be put on display ASAP in as many ways as possible until people understand."
"I know the new vid is comin', so i will ask about something else. peanut butter song: you recorded the jar hits on to a MIDI track and then just moved the notes to form the major and then add 9 chords, right? It seems more practical than just playing chords in sync or trying to re-sync 'em. just that. keep it awesome and hellyeahish.","the song was actually recorded around early 2010. it was called this song yeah and it's hardly a song, it's just me slamming a major chord several times in a row. During 2014, as part of the weekly content schedule, one of the videos each week is supposed to be a 'music video' which is when you make a video to go along to a song that's already recorded. so for a thrill, i decided to try an instrumental song. i picked this song yeah. the idea that worked best was a jar of peanut butter. when the video was done, it only made sense to change the title. most of the time i aim for strict musical accuracy in my videos, because it is usually more thrilling, especially for musician viewers, but in this particular video the notes are ignored. mainly because it is impossible to play a major triad with a peanut butter jar."
do people ever call you ben?,not usually.
How do you concentrate on things you think is boring?,"step 1 is to see if there is a way to avoid the thing entirely. if you really can't avoid it, and it is still boring, then keep looking for ways to avoid it. and if you still can't avoid it, then really try to understand the reason you can't avoid it, and plan on crafting magnificent stories about your struggle."
ok i have figured out what the notes sound like (i have pressed every key). what do i do next?,"use them in any way you like. try pressing 2 notes at a time. try pressing notes and holding them, or pressing them fast. try pressing no notes. try as many things as you can. the more you play, the more things you will discover. the world is yours. enjoy. if this is not enjoyable you may also leave the instrument."

Can you do me a favor? Flip a coin and tell me which side it lands on?,
I'm working on a song and somehow I ended up a half-step above my original key so I can't make it loop yet. Are there any cool turnaround tricks (or examples from real songs) to get me back down a half-step? I could add a few more sections if I have to.,"every situation is unique. i evaluate these types of issues on a case by case basis. don't forget to consider the possibility of returning to the beginning in the new key, or the possibility of not looping at all."
"realistically, about when do you think the video will be finished? does two weeks from now seem reasonable?",

Can you drop some more mad hints and give us an idea on how close you are to finishing the new History of [blank] video? The last one that really gave us an idea of the progress you made was a checklist comparing it to the one for history of Japan.,"the 'graphics' phase was finished on feb 7. after that, the process is a little bit more confusing to explain. it's a lot of smaller things -- final narration, jingle vocals, editing jingles and narration, mixing, re-alignment to fit final narration timing, and the score. the score is the most subtantial item of all of those, but not as large as 'graphics.' it is hard to exactly explain the process because i have been bouncing around depending on whether it's day or night (vocal recording, etc) and also i was sick and had lingering sick voice for a couple weeks, so during that time i made an early detour into doing the score, somewhere around feb 19. so i basically locked up the narration timing up until 7:50 (that was as far as i had gotten) and started on the score. by the time i reached 7:50 in the score (this was around march 2 i guess), i was able to resume vocals, and was bouncing around between doing jingles and narration.  narration is now solidly in place with correct timing, video re-alignment to fit that new timing is done, now starting on the rest of the score, from 8min to the end. once the score is done, it is just the small little tasks like year labels, other labels, graphics adjustments, mixing, etc etc etc but these small tasks tend to fly by very fast, and once the score is done it tends to be a slippery slope to the end of the process. this is what i know from experience on doing the previous long video of this type. i hope that makes sense."

And then he looks at me. And I stare at him. And he says I like your shirt, man. I've listened to Abbey Road so many times. Rock on and I just keep staring at him and I look to my grandma and to him and I'm sure I looked like I was going insane and then he starts talking again and he's like I even love that stupid octopuses garden song and I'm like bill? And he's like what and my grandma is like no it was the other guy in the Beatles who wrote that song and then he gets in an argument with my grandma about who wrote that song and I'm just standing there watching him scan my grandmas adult diapers and scream at her and in my head I'm thinking THIS IS BILL FUCKING WURTZ or possibly his twin brother that lives in Florida AND HE KNOWS ALL THE SECRETS TO THE UNIVERSE because he was winning the argument and I assumed he knew everything else as well. and basically: this shook me, bill.","i don't say rock on, and i'm not terribly interested in abbey road. in general, the points of interest for me on that record are 'her majesty,' 'maxwell silverhammer,' 'she came in thru the bathroom window,' 'polythene pam', and the wild items list in the verses (not the chorus) of 'come together'. but unlike ryen, i am not too interested in the entire album."

"several times, you've mentioned your upcoming weekly/bi-weekly song schedule. is that gonna be strict or are you keeping your 'upload immediately after it is finished' policy?","there are many questions to be worked out. such as how to pick the songs, when to write, what the schedule is, whether there are videos, whether to release songs in groups, etc. those questions will be answered immediately after this video is done."

"when you say songs forever, you don't mean the whole rest of your life, right? at what point do you think you'll go back to other stuff? or will it be other stuff all the time once you've finished your song for the week?","like i started trying to write songs in 2007, then i tried some different approaches, then i really started writing a lot more in 2009, then i tried some more approaches, then in 2010 i recorded maybe 5% of the songs i had written, and then kept writing more anyway, and wrote way way more, then in 2011 i decided that the stuff i was writing was cool but way too insane and i should try to do more normal stuff. so in 2011 i wrote a bunch of normal stuff, and recorded maybe 25% of those, then i got bored with normal stuff and wrote more crazy stuff. and finally in 2012 i was like 'what the fuck is going on here i've written so much stuff and i'll never have time to record it all because it takes longer to record than to write and i keep wanting to write more.' so i organized everything i had ever written, and then wrote more. so throughout 2012-13 i wrote like crazy, updating and organizing everything i had written, fixing it, updating it, etc. and in 2013 i was like, ok, wowwww, now i really think i'm a pro writer and i've got so many hundreds of songs written. time to record it and maybe put it online. then i built a webiste. then i filled the website with all the previous recordings, etc. but then i was like, wait hold on, what about videos? i've wanted to do videos for a long time and i bet it would work, and it would be a good way to get people to pay attention to me. so i started making videos on a regular basis for a couple years and also making stupid tweets to attract attention. then the attention came. guess what now it's time to do the songs i mentioned before."
"to the person who asked about death being necessary: death by ageing is caused by deterioration of the telomeres that cap chromosomes, which means that eventually the cells aren't able to divide anymore, so they die. it's called cell senescence (and some cells like rat brain cells don't have this problem and they can keep on dividing forever). so it is possible that in the future we could maybe prevent death, by altering DNA so that the telomeres don't go bad. (telomeres shorten after each cell replication). I don't know if you'll post this but I think it's cool info that people don't hear about unless they search for it specifically?",

"Have you ever considered having someone help editing your videos?  I mean, if you're happy with the progress you're making right now, an extra pair of hands might get in the way of your creative process.  However, if there's other projects you'd like to finish as well, but can't because you're too busy with this gigantic History of the Universe video, don't you think it's worth the mild sacrifice of creative control?I'm asking this not as some impatient fan but as someone who can't imagine crafting one youtube video for multiple years in a row.  I'd personally lose sight of what I was doing just a few months in and might grow to despise what I once promised to myself I'd happily accomplish.",

"Based on what I've seen in the reality videos, it seems like your songwriting process involved getting a bunch of rough ideas out in a period of writing and then going back and working with whatever was good. Is this accurate and would you recommend it as a method of making things?","i have used a wide range of strategies over the years. i would recommend trying anything you can, and then over time perhaps try new things. and then if you're still alive after all that, perhaps combine different elements of all the things you've tried."
I noticed you are updating the questions more frequently. why did you speed it up?,i did not.

"IS there a real password to the reality section, or did you just make it so it refreshes every time you enter something in.",
"how do you feel about adding titles to your songs when you eventually make a video? for example, the song hide from strangers has a totally different meaning than being a human, explained. another example would be just try to have a good time having its meaning changed when you made a video and changed the title to homework help. I hope this question makes sense.","both of those examples were actually written as videos. then later i took the music and put it on the songs page, and titled the music accordingly."

is vanuatu in the new video?,no.
"After your next big video, do you think you'll make some more songs? I love them.","the plan is to release songs rapid fire on an extremely regular basis. all other things (videos, reality updates, etc) will have to be done on the side, as a second priority to the song schedule. at least until i catch up to the years of writing i have done."

are there any secrets in the new vid?,oh hell yeah.
why are you being very much Less Secretive about the contents of hotewig than you were with the contents of hoj?,"i am not. it is more secretive this time. some people don't even know what the video is about, or what it's called. where as last time i was very open about the whole thing."
"since it takes a long time to go through and edit the reality videos, couldn't you just upload all the raw footage?",hahahahahahahaha sure.
i am confused about the video no castle there is a castle in it 76% of the time could you explain it?,"have you considered the idea that no is not whether or not there is a castle, but a specification as to what kind of castle? just a thought. i'm not really sure. keep in mind, it was done as a garbage instrumental track, probably to get out of writers block, done years before there was ever a video."

Have you ever thought of doing one new reality section entry every day/week/month instead of doing large chunks at once?,yes.

so I've been only aware of your youtube content for a while and it seems like you don't talk about yourself or your video making process on there. I'm not trying to scream into the pit of work harder because you died billiam but I want to know why you prefer the smaller community of your website compared to the larger one on youtube?,"the youtube comment section has become pretty terrifying. this is a much safer space, and i can choose which questions to post."
"bill how do i stop my heart from beating so hard? my heart beats so hard because i'm so excited about finishing my project, and i can't go to sleep at night. it's really throwing me off. i thought you might have experience with something like this and was wondering what you did to calm down?",think about the ground.

what do you make of people's desire to ask your advice on the more ambiguous and nebulous parts of life?,it is a nice challenge.

"Oreos, Cookie or Cream?",
what do you think is a good approach towards people freebooting your content?,"i'm really not sure. almost every approach is stressful, and distracts me from making new content."
How did you go about animating the notation in your classic the high class stuff?,"i will explain a single page first (the multi-page spread is another issue)... let's say there is just one page of notation, like 8 bars or whatever.... I make the notation in a notation program, and screenshot it. (then i actually make several alignment adjustments in graphics, because notation programs are incredibly finicky, it's easier to adjust things in graphics)... then i save it how i want. then i use graphics to erase the last note (and any chord that goes along with it.) i erase notes on a staff by just dragging empty staff over it. and i save as and then add a 1 to the file name. repeat, keep erasing the next note and 'save as'. then you have a stack of files all in order. then import. then allign the timing. it's the exact same way i do text, but with text i type it out and screenshot each frame, and delete words (easier, instead of erasing them). the delete technique would not work in a notation program, because the notes and alignment will change as you delete them. that's why i use graphics. it's not that hard, and i'm not even using a graphics program. just an image preview program, and i'm just copying and pasting boxes. the mccartney video was a bit more ambitious because i wanted to do a steady scroll. so i thought it would be good to make one huge image file that is the entire length of the score. and then do the erase per frame technique.... so then all the frames were huge... and then export that to a really high res video and scroll the video??? i don't remember if this was successful, but you run into major problems when you try to do huge things like that. processing power limitations, etc. Same sort of crisis occured when i was trying to do the zoom out on the japanese army. i ended up having to somehow break the task into smaller pieces. if i recall. i somehow succeeded in getting a steady scroll on the notation, only to find out that it was too hard to read when it's moving like that!! so i ended up keeping it still and then sliding forward page by page. if i had known the steady scroll wasn't going to work, i probably would have broken it into pages from the start."
is there a problem with this anagram?My name is bill and I hate myselffinish my disney meatball meal?,no.
According to a video you put on YouTube in December 29th 2013 you hibernated on November 19th 2015 or were planning to at the time. Did you actually hibernate or what?- Mr. Freak?,"ah, right. that song was written and recorded in 2010, audio only with no video. the video was made in 2013 and i thought it would be a cool idea for the video if i show a calendar date. i picked a date far far in the future that i thought would never arrive. i never had plans of hibernating, the song is fictional. i had no idea what i would be doing on nov 19, 2015, that was a randomly selected date. it turns out i would be working on history of japan. while also trying to do vines every day, at the same time. certainly did not hibernate although i may have wanted to."
you haven't updated the hotewig page for 5 days. are you ok?,"i am fine. updating that page is not really a huge priority, because hardly anyone is reading it. i am busy doing a huge video. there are usually many questions per day relating to the video, and it takes time to go through and copy them over. not that important, considering the page is kind of a secret page anyway. i usually update it whenever someone asks for a link to the page, so that it's updated when they link to it."
"If I made a typo in my question and I am afraid that you would misunderstand the entire question, is there any way I can edit it?","you can't edit it after you send it, but if you send it again and let me know it is an edit, i am usually very understanding about it. i will post the one you meant, and not the one you didn't mean, and even switch it if it's already posted. and also edit out the editing instructions."

Pretzels?,
when you respond to questions with oh hell yeah is that code for something else?,"perhaps something like yes, very much, absolutely!"
Will you love me pls?,
Any reason as to why you didn't post your music in lossless? Does the player only support mp3?,"faster load time, and i honestly can't tell the difference. when it goes to the music stores, i send the full .wav, because they require it."
what is the real next video?,"it depends if you mean the one i have been working on for the past 8 months, or the one after that. both of which will be real."

opinion on people who demand a profanity-free version of history of japan?,"it's pretty annoying, because i don't want there to be one. but i feel pressured to make one to prevent someone else from making one."
wouldn't you say that people who comment on your videos and ask questions on this page are a part of your creative process?,"they can learn about it, but they usually won't influence it."
"so bill, i just wanted to say we're all super proud of you (at least i am). i mean, almost 9 months on this ridiculously huge project (i know you work all the time, but it must be hard and i know you're dying to do song releases already), that's impressive, insane even. so, you're awesome, keep up the good work! as for my question: what's left on the video?","mainly the score. then mixing, and a few more graphics fixes, adding labels, etc. also final vocals for jingles."
do you read books. if so what is your favourite book?,
Do you work on projects even when you're sick?,oh hell yeah.
Do you still answer old questions?,
when is the next video coming out?,
"why was history of japan enough practice at doing long crazy documentaries, enough so that you could take this huge massive leap you are taking in scope of the project? i hope this question make sense i dont think it does?","because the process for history of japan went totally smoothly and successfully on the first try. the reason for this is because i had so much practice making shorter videos. the leap from japan to this video is large, but not as big as the leap from short videos to the japan video."
have you ever typed 'video' as 'videow' by accident(or on purpose)?,not that i know of.
"those shots on the new video look beautiful, how much will i learn about the world you're gonna be showing me?",you will learn that it's round. i'm not sure what else.

u ok my dude?,
What happened to the daily Instagrams until the video release?,"i felt it was going a little too fast, and too predictable. i have more. but i decided to skip a day or 2, to keep it interesting."
"If time travel and genderswaping is possible, do you suppose someone could go back in time, twice, and become their own parents, assuming this does not create a time paradox.","i think everyone is already doing that anyway. and much, much, more."
have you ever thought about making t-shirts?,no but i've thought about not doing it.
"Do you consider getting help to make videos? Mostly on slow, repetitive or minor tasks, so the style and soul of the thing is still yours?","yes, that seems legit. i look forward to that, one day when i am a well established, wealthy and influential member of society."
how can I keep myself from getting discouraged when grades seem to be slipping and tests seem to be getting harder?,"try to understand who makes the tests, and why it is so important that you pass their tests."
why does the captain sink with his ship?,perhaps because he or she has a certain attachment to it.

Are you done making the video?,i will check.

Why do you care about people seeing the videos you make?,the same reason you might care if someone hears you when you are speaking.
"For what purpose do you make your videos, exactly? Would you still make them even if you had no audience other than yourself?","i would start doing it, regardless of whether there is an audience. knowing that if i do it long enough, and ruthlessly enough, i will eventually get an audience. and by that time i might even be better at it."
In the question of Do you dream? there was no time stamp or date. What is the reason for this?,the question was Hi. Are you tired? Do you dream? and it contains 2 questions. so the answer to the first question was placed in between the first question and the second question. i hope that makes sense.
Do you think that you swear more or less in this video than the Japan one?,i don't have an accurate system for determining what counts as a swear.
Isthe Isthmus of Panama featured in the new vid?,yes.

"As a Content Creator, do you feel like YouTube's platform does a good job of conveying your brand's unique message to your key demographics?","it's just a video player. i prefer simpler players, or just to share the video files, but it seems society at large prefers youtube, so i use it, in addition to sharing the videos on my website."

"One reality video has you saying that i'm crazy/it's raining you were worried was a clunker-I don't think it turned out that way (I think it's an amazing song), but how do you feel on it?","the fact that that song got picked is a classic example of the problems of randomization. it was picked randomly, and it's quite a downer. and yet if i try to just decide which song to do, it seems like each one has a reason i shouldn't do it, which is why i use randomization."
"Looking at the earlier reality videos, I had a few questions: first, did the advent of your success on vine and with Japan help you realize working in your own mould (as opposed to verse-chorus format) truly was the best thing?","no. it was around 2011 that i started trying to do verse chorus, and when the fans found out they were mostly very disappointed, and wanted me to keep it crazy.  around 2012/13 i really started to put the best of both together, and wrote probably hundreds of songs. then i was going to record them but i started making videos instead."

how would you go about making a music video for a song without words?,"use abstract reasoning. examples of ones i've done would be 'time mop,' 'no castle,' and 'the peanut butter song' which was not called the peanut butter song until the video was made because there was no peanut butter in the song."
can u teach me music theory?,it's best when you make up your own theory.
When do you think you can get the big video out?,
Can you please release the video on march 17th it's my birthday that would be the best present ever thank you?,that would be nice but i'm not sure if it's possible.

what do you use to record your reality entries?,an image of the device is actually shown in one of the first car journals.
"Will you post the reality videos one at a time, or post them all together once they're all done?","i might post them gradually. i'm going to be doing it as an ongoing side project this time, which is different from the way i did it before, which was all at once."

is there a specific song you want to make the first of the weekly/bi-weekly songs you release?,"no. picking songs has always been very strange for me. i can never decide whether to use randomization or not.  looking forward to getting that sorted out, and it will be more exciting this time because i am including new writing in the process."

Have you considered having 'pinned' questions at the top of this page?,no.
"is it hard to upload to upload the more personal songs/reality videos? or do they just seem to be more personal?also, thank you. wish we could meet someday, but that's never gonna happen?",the upload is very easy. nowadays you can do it with just a click of a button.
how can you describe your music? i want to get your sound but I don't know where to start?,"music is already in audio form so i don't think it's ever necessary to describe music, unless the person you are describing it to is some how unable to hear the music. i hope that makes sense."

I usually wait and watch it again the next morning since I'll catch mistakes easier that way.,it doesn't count as finished until i have done extensive and detailed inspection.

"If you had to choose between having absolutely perfect pitch but always getting annoyed when someone is out of tune at all, or always being out of tune but being able to enjoy music as you do now, what would you choose?","i'm not sure you are understanding quite how perfect pitch works. the name of perfect pitch is misleading. it makes more sense to call it 'absolute pitch.' and you don't need to have absolute pitch to know whether something is out of tune with itself. only to know whether it is overall tuned to A=440hz. and whether or not something is tuned to A=440hz does not affect whether or not it sounds 'in tune'. anyone claiming to be annoyed by something because it is not tuned to A=440 is lying, and using it as an excuse to brag that they have absolute pitch. in fact some people even claim things are not A=440 when they actually are, especially nowadays, with most music being made on computers where all the instruments are by default set to A=440."
"Also, how do you like your eggs? Fried? Scrambled? Boiled? Entirely raw?",

It's gonna be long and wild and crazy and there's no way that 30+ pictures can encapsulate the thrill of watching the completed video. I mean, I've seen History of Japan countless times and there are still little details that I missed before. So, do whatever you wanted to do. Do you agree?",oh hell yeah.
was the december 2016 release date ever a realistic option?,almost.
"when answering questions about the video not being done sooner and not uploading other videos, i've seen you call yourself a terrible person. why so?","when working your hardest for hundreds of days in a row, and then being criticized for not working harder, you tend to lose your mind."
do you think that it should have been done sooner and you believe you're slacking?,"i wish it would be done sooner, but that would be physically impossible."
"do you think that as a content creator, we deserve videos in the meantime until the history video is uploaded?","the fans have spoken, and they do not want that. why aren't you making a long video they say, when i try to put a short video up while also working on a long video."
or is was it just a joke? i hope you take as much time thats needed to make the video so it turns out better.,i will do the best i can.
Are you gonna make a trailer for the video ur working on?,no.
"in the new video, is the date 1337 mentioned.?",no.
bill i hope you realise that you are about to upload what will become a very popular video. it will become the thing of legends?,that would be cool but there is really no guarantee of that.

how many dog have you eatten in the last minute?,0.
Please help me?,
whats the reason you started keeping an audio journal? when do you think its a good idea for a person to do it?,it's just a good way to get things sorted out. and the idea that you could one day edit it down and make it presentable is exciting. makes you feel like you have an audience.
"ur reality thing is an awesome rollercoaster, will u ever do more? it'd be cool to see your thought process through the making of this colossal project?",after this video i will fill it in up to the present. i would like to do as much as possible.
"I am subscribed to your channelWhy did you make some music? Was it some person, inspiration, or just creatvity?Also, are you planning on dedicating time to music or another thing you like to do?Also, do you like dogs?",i have been making music all my life. i am a musician. i started making videos because it is great way to get people to pay attention to you. there is still much more music to be made.
do you think you've had the biggest freak out panic attack of your life?,i think so.
When is the video coming out?! Could you give us a specific date?,

"hey bill, i am a musician and, like yourself, i am in favour of originality and weird shit, but having jumped into the musician industry i have realised that it primarily consists of sycophants and shallowness which makes me very sad.how do i become successful at music while still being different and happy?","if you can't deal with anyone else and you want to do things your own way, you may be living in the right time."
"Is it fair to say that this website is the biggest thing to happen to you in the last 5 or so years, and if not what is?","yes but also perhaps the 5 day schedule that i started immediately after filling the website, which was made possible by having a website."
"You're incredibly self-motivated in your personal projects. Were you reliant on other people for motivation throughout your life, and if you were how did you change that?For someone like me, whose motivation comes 99% from other people telling me to work on my projects, do you have any tips? How do I become as motivated as you are to work on things?",it depends what you want to accomplish.
"Is there any process that you use for tagging the videos you use for reality and improv? e.g. oh, i talk about the video schedule in this one so i should tag it with that.",tagged? they are not tagged. i don't know what you mean.

(e.g. editing the videos between now and HoJ before going back to what you skipped)?",i will do an update from 2.2.16 thru present. maybe later in life i will find time to fill it in more.

"I'm concerned that when you upload, it might be a few hours before I log into youtube and see that it's up.  How will we know when your mad hints will finally culminate in the release of the big video?","when i post the video, i will leave it online. that way, you can still watch it at a later time. 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, any number of hours after it is released. or later, if you like."
specifically what time of day will your next video come out?,i have no idea. but 12noon UTC seems reasonable.
Can you also post the crazy hints somewhere else for people without an Instagram please?,you don't need to have instagram to look at instagram pictures. you can just go to the.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wirtzfix this?,it looks fine to me. but even if something was wrong it wouldn't be my job to fix it. i don't work at wikipedia.
"have you ever worn a green morph suit, jumped off your fridge and said to yourself, I'm gay?",no.
What exactly was the process behind editing the reality videos? How exactly did you split up and spend that time over the 3 months or so that you were editing them?,"i started going through all the recordings from the beginning and figuring out which parts i wanted to use, and as the project dragged on past 2 weeks, i steadily started to panic more and more and start trying to go faster and faster, skipping more and more, until eventually for the 2014 and 2015 recordings i basically just randomly looked at maybe 1 out of every 20 files and just found bits. as the project dragged on for months, i started really just taking wild stabs in the dark and just taking anything i could find. i originally thought it was going to actually chronical details for making specific videos, etc etc etc. but after 3 months i had no choice but to drastically simplify the project. but the great news is it got done, and at least now something is online."

"if so, was it difficult to write material that was entertaining without being offensive?",yes.

Should we expect a video by next Wednesday?,no.
does your video mention rhinoceroseses?,no.
"you worked on the reality section for 3 months, does it bother you that not many people in relation to your whole fanbase know about it?","no, it is supposed to be low key. it is very personal and real. only for people who really want to get to know me, and won't judge me for talking to myself on a regular basis to sort things out. if i wanted it to be more widely seen, i would have posted it on youtube. that's also the reason i put a fake 'password' page as a gentle reminder of the sensitivity of the material."
