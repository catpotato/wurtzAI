"hey Bill, i just read your update on the new project and how you are looking for faster ways to make videos. This is a very relevant issue for me as well, and i have some ideas that might be of use... i started out making everything in After Effects (i dont know what software you use but this should be relevant regardless) which is great and amazing but non efficient especially when you have a identity of textures and tones that is some kind of starting point and a through line through all your different projects but reusing previous stuff from other After Effects projects feels werid and is not ideal. i have recently been learning a coding language called Processing which i am using to create programs to execute visuals before i bring them into After Effects. For a a hopefully relevant example to you, i could make a program where i can type in text, have a rgb slider for base color of text, create duplicates of text on top of one another with differ ent colo rs and choose a display style like a repeating pattern of text or a silly wobble distortion or something. Then i can save the text as a picture or video and then do the polishing in After Effects. These little programs you can make for various reasons and reused without loosing freshness or constraints as you can easily add a few parameters to the code for every projects adding on to the base you have built up which you can execute and use immediately. The beginning of this process is the worst by far and takes time but it seems to me like the efficiency ratio is a constant upward line with no plateauing and from your knowledge of html from making this website, i think the starting momentum would not be too terribly slow. this might be helpful to you, thank you for changing the world all the time?",i would like to talk more about this! have you checked out my email address on the email page of this site.

"Bill, I have to write a character description of a PLANT. A plant that has had no dialogue or personality in the story whatsoever. (The river plant from Gilgamesh). What should I do?? IT IS A PLANT!!!! >:(?","describe what it does for the story. if you are having trouble, try deleting the plant from the story, and figure out what's different. or, as another approach, try to imagine a different way that the plant could be which would make the story different. then re-set to the way the plant is, and that might give you a better picture of what needs to be mentioned, when talking about the plant and what it's doing for the story. i mean it's gotta do something for the story otherwise it wouldn't be there. or who knows, maybe it shouldn't be there, in which case maybe you could make that argument."

Hi bill its your mom?,no its not.
pls help bill what are the time signatures in i wanna be a movie star? i've been struggling to discover it but it's so difficult and?,"the main hook/chorus is 4+5 (alternating 4, and 5.) the verse goes 4, 5, 4, 5, 3, 3, 6 (i know you may think it makes no sense to use 3's and 6's both, but that's just the way i think of it. you could break any of these up any way you want) and the second half of the first verse is the same BUT, i can't remember, there might be an extra beat at the end of the verse, so the second time around might be 7 or 6. i remember there was some discrepancy here, different ones felt like they needed to be different ways. i haven't heard it since it was released. the end of each verse might be either 6 or 7, you'll have to count yourself, i haven't heard it since it was released and i'm not listening to it now. The chorus right before the bridge is cut short, so that entire chorus would be 4, 5, 4, 5, 4, 5, 4, 3. The bridge is 6, 7, 6, 4, 7 (you could break this up in many different ways. also not totally sure about what the hang time is on the end of the bridge, i don't remember for sure) all these times are expressed in terms of quarter notes. so when i say 5 that means 5/4."
