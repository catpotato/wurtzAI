"Are there certain questions you won't answer because the reptilians, illumanti, alien overlords and/or the vril-ya have forbidden you to reveal certain things?","well, they never specifically say what you can't say. you just kind of know what they probably don't want you to say, and you also are pretty sure they can vapourize you."
"I know this is probably a tough question, but do you have any tips on writing melodies? If you give me a melody, I can arrange it (figure out harmonies, bass line, drum beats etc)... but I always hear people say that melodies just 'come to them', like they just appear out of nowhere in their heads like magic... but this has never been the case for me. I usually write a chord pattern that I think sounds interesting, then I try to build a melody from the notes in the chords. Sometimes I can do it, sometimes I can't. But I know I'm doing it backwards. Melody should come first. Melody is the most important part of a song.","when writing a melody, it's sometimes hard to know 'why' you're writing the melody if there's no lyric with it. like, who cares if the notes go here or there? what's it for? what is this even about? but when you are delivering a message, through words (musical words) then all of a sudden everything has meaning. i'm not suggesting you do lyrics first, that route seems bland as hell to me. i'm suggesting you do lyric and melody at the same time. perhaps other people do it differently but that's the only way it goes for me."
Your first song I'm stuck in a Rut states that you are indeed stuck in a rut. Are you still stuck in that rut?,no.

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa?,i know what you mean.

or are you able to appreciate the art as separate from the artist?,"it's important to remember that usually i don't actually know the artist personally. sometimes very famous people might have a flawed public image, which doesn't necessarily reflect how they really are. which is why it's even more important to look at the art directly, and ignore whatever scandals the newspapers may be trying to focus on."
What music harmony do you frequently use?,"major 3rds, and many others as well."

"does a water molecule have two hydrogens and an oxygen, or two oxygens and a hydrogen?","2 hydrogens, 1 oxygen. the number goes after the letter it's counting, which is the opposite of how it goes in algebra. i'm sorry about that."
Do you think it's right to use How are you as a casual greeting when no one cares how the other person actually is?,"almost every language uses it, so there must be something right about it."

is there a trick to the claw machine games? i've never been able to grab anything.,"yes, that's the trick. the trick is to make you think you can grab something but really you won't be able to. that way the owners keep all the money while spending as little as possible on the prizes."
"Why do you think certain contractions never get used by themselves? For example, you might say I'm hungry. But if somebody asks Hey, are you hungry? You'd never respond by just saying I'm (you'd say 'I am' or 'yes' or 'no' or maybe 'I'm not'). Or you might say I'd like to go to the movies. But if somebody asks if you want to go to the movies, you wouldn't just say I'd.","in those examples, the second word needs to be emphasized, because the entire question focuses on whether that word is positive or negative. and it is impossible to give a word its own emphasis when it is part of a contraction."
where's the best place to reside myself on this spherical thing i live on?,that is something only you can discover.
What do you think about Math?,seems legit.
"Is it the listener or the composer who gets to decide (or chose not to decide) rather or not something is music?

Can you teach me how to make good music?,"i will try, but if you really want it to be good you are going to have to figure it out yourself, through experimentation."
"Any particular reason(s) why you like incorporating the text of the lyrics into your videos? Don't get me wrong, I like how you do that. I think it gives the words some extra oomph and character (like making certain words with big and bold letters, others small, or cursive, etc), you can also accentuate certain lines (like 'welcome' or 'fun there' or 'pregnant' or 'aliens' etc). Maybe I just answered my own question?","ah, yes."
do your videos rly have deep meaning like ppl say? or are they just plain random. great work btw?,"the main meaning is let's see what kinds of ways i can express myself through videos. which i think is a very deep meaning, and not random, because i think expression is vitally important."
outside based on true events?,no.
Is there any reason the planet catches on fire after you are taken away by a spaceship?,"yes. on round 3 i was looking for dull spots in the video and that spot just had nothing happening, and the ground looked so boring, so i figured why not add some fire. after i added it, i realized it has interesting implications. are the aliens saving you? did they set your planet on fire before saving you? and if so, were you aware that they did it, or did they make it seem like a natural disaster in which case you would think they saved you? i also flipped the colors around because why not. which only makes it look more alien."
I added Outside to my playlist. Should I feel embarrassed about this?,should i be embarrassed if someone is telling me they might be embarrassed to like my music.
how's the content-making coming along?,good.
Were any pizzas harmed during the making of conversations with a pizza pie?,no.
That text for the gonna go out and away from the lines looks SO familiar! Is that the text style from the real book?,"i don't think it's from the real book, but i think it is used in a lot of music charts you may have seen. the font is called 'jazz chords' or something, and it is part of a bunch of music fonts that i have for some reason, which i think came from finale or some other notation program which i don't use. i also used that font a few other times in the video, such as the 3rd 'outside' of the first chorus."
"Question date-9/29/174 questions-I don't know if it's allowed, but idc, so let's go!1.Do you ever start answers with a capital letter?",it doesn't seem necessary but i'm sure i have probably done it before.

"When you sing a song in the 1st person, are you singing it from your own perspective?",not necessarily.
"Like, I know song lyrics aren't always meant to be taken literally... But when you sing things like I wanna go outside or I wanna be a movie star or I know of a cool place to go or I'm a diamond... do you think of the I as being you, bill wurtz?",not necessarily.
"Or the song from the perspective of a character who wants to go outside, or a character who wants to be a movie star, or a character who knows of a cool place to go, or a character who is a diamond, etc.?",that doesn't usually factor into consideration. just trying to make the song i want to make.
"do you think Antarctica feels bad that, because of its life choices, almost every map cuts it in half and spreads it around on the bottom?",antarctica doesn't use those maps.
What is the meaning of the songs 'I wanna be a movie star' and 'Outside'?,"it's 2017 and let's see if i can really just take one of these stray unfinished title lines from the archives, and finish it promptly like a god damn professional."
Do you forgive me?,for what.
"Sometimes you seem to be an introvert, but how can this be when you have 1M subscribers, and have lots of content that people view, including some with your face in them?","those qualities are actually common introvert qualities. but i am not necessecarily an introvert, nor extrovert."
Hey. May I inquire if you could please post another video of your working on a project (like the Tonga time video)? They're always so great to see. Thanks so much.,"there are many many more but the lighting and sound is usually absolutely attrocious, because the point of those videos is not to be good videos, but it is simply a way of writing things down. although i do plan on using that footage extensively in behind the scenes videos, which i will make in the future."
"In the history of the world i guess, was there any specific parts you enjoyed the most?",being done with it.

"9.29.172:35 ambut you could sell 95 to 99 of the 100 suitcases and earn more bucks, depending on how many suitcases you bring to your adventures in foreign lands.","that's true, and i thought of that after i answered, but honestly it's not worth the trouble to deal with selling all the suitcases. i already have another business that i am happier with, and enjoy more than selling suitcases."
"hi bill, what is my purpose?",hold on i will look it up.
what is your opinion on the puppies or kittens debate?,"where i'm from, puppies and kittens can both exist. it is nice."
"if i create something that i like, how do i make other people like it?","if you make it so that you like it, there are probably many other people that would like it. so what you need to do is to figure out how to get as many people to pay attention to you as possible, to increase the chances that the ones who will like what you do will find you."
date taylor swift?,i will try.
What do you mean by hymnifying the second half or fractal-like duck form?,"hymnifying the second half' is what i sometimes call the thing in a traditional song form where the 4th 8th is the 5 chord, and the 8th 8th is the 1 chord, and the 7th 8th usually contains 1 over 5 and 5. you've heard it thousands of times. she'll be coming around the mountain, etc. Fractal like duck form is a phenomenon that occurs where the landing point of the first half is in the same relative time position as the landing point of the whole thing, relative to the whole thing. so for example, over the course of a 4 bar phrase of lyrics, let's say your first line lands halfway through the second bar, that's squarely on the 4th quarter of the first half. then your next line should have its landing point at the top of the 4th bar, which is the halfway point of the second half, and hence the start of the 4th quarter of the whole thing. so your landing point of the entire thing is in the same position relative to the whole as the landing poing of the first half was to the first half. this creates a fractal-like self-similarity that the mind responds very well to, and is present in many many lyrics/songs and rhythmic poems."
Why is 6 afraid of 7?,"it is not, they get along well, but they have staged a feud, for publicity."
What are the chords for the wind blows& moonlight parts in outside?

hi bill will you come hang out in new haven i will take you out 2 eat pizza?,oh that sounds nice.
Does the laws of the universe (and the world) video relate to your ask.fm?,"no, it seems a lot of people misunderstood that video. i kept explaining again and again that it is about asking questions to yourself and the world around you, but everyone keeps thinking it meant asking questions to me. the line was actually something i found written in a notebook many years ago. but i tried to clarify by adding the title, but apparently that did not work."
"For outside, was that written recently after the last video, or was it one of those songs where a part had been written but you finished writing it just now?","the title line came from a writing session last march. everything else was written after it was randomly selected from the list, in august, to be the next song/video."

"How do I know if I will be good at writing music or enjoy it if I don't have the instruments or money to buy instruments?Whenever I try to imagine a melody in my head, I always fear that the melody would be heavily influenced or even a straight rip-off of what I have heard in the past subconsciously without me realising. Do you experience this?","you're just gonna have to try some things. on one end of the spectrum, just do what feels familiar, and it may be similar to things that already existed (which is not always the biggest crime, considering 95% of music is very very similar to other music that existed before in many ways). and the opposite side of the spectrum is try things that are so outlandish that they are guaranteed to be different, even if they might be totally insane and not good. chances are you will stumble upon something good anyway. but either way it is important to try many many different things, on both sides of the spectrum, and you will very quickly learn how to fly the plane."
"i'm currently struggling with writer's block, and i dont mean lyrics but trying to find a chord progression that sounds nice / having no idea what the next segment of a song should be, have you ever encountered that kind of problem?ps: great fan <3?",sure.

there is an automatic answer response for how are you when asked on this website saying good. but how is it possible to always feel good? surely you have your bad days.,"yes but the answer to how are you is not really supposed to explain how things are going, unless you are trying to hijack a casual greeting into a therapy session."
"When writing backwards, have you ever came up with such a good verse that the chorus pales in comparison?","yes, or just generally very often the verse might be great but doesn't match the chorus."
"What would you do then, make the chorus better or make the verse shittier?",basically all i can do is just file that verse as a different song and try again.
did outside have like a million kajillion layers?,"well sort of, but what i usually do is make a thing with a bunch of layers and then print it to one layer, and then print some more things to another layer, and then layer those layers."
"why are all the letters on a computer keybord captitals in real life, but when you press them they usually make lowercase letters?","i think when letters are used in words they work better as lowercase, but when they used as individual letters, they work best capital."

What was your first reaction to you getting recognition from your history of Japan? And how did you think it would affect your content from then on?,"it was convenient because prior to that my strongest following was on a platform with a 6 and a half second time limit. i was more than ready to make longer content. unfortunately there are many challenges and perils that go along with that, such as it takes much much longer to make."
What are your thoughts on the people that think the Earth is flat?,i think way more people think people think the earth is flat than actually think the earth is flat. i think the entire flat earth movement might be a fabrication to give people an opportunity to brag about knowing the world is round.
Are you dreaming?,yes.
Do you plan on getting better at drawing cars and spaceships?,i plan on making them more and more interesting. i'm not sure if that answers your question.
"If your videos were played back to back on a cable channel, what would the channel be called?",i think something like 'bill wurtz' would be fine.
Would you rather find one suitcase full of hundred dollar bills or one hundred suitcases full of one dollar bills?,"assuming they are filled the same amount, the 1 suitcase would be much much more space efficient for the same amount of money."

Do you enjoy viewing/listening to your own work?,"i try to make it what i would find most enjoyable. but i don't listen to it when it is done. for 2 reasons, actually 3 reasons. 1. i surely heard it way way more than i ever needed to, 2. i can't change it anymore so why worry about it, and 3. i am busy making the next thing."
how would you describe your aesthetic?,"i believe aesthetic should be shared, by the community."

For example during do you have a nice car (i wanna be a movie star) and efg (second chorus of alphabet shuffle). How do you make that sound and why did you choose to use it?,"a lot of people ask about it, and i have saved it as 'alien crickets' but it is not just the sound, it also requires to play the notes in a certain pattern to get that sound. maybe one day i will say how it was made and where it came from."
do you think you're ever going to make another music video featuring videos of you?,oh hell yeah.
"if you only had the hook written for outside when it was randomly chosen, what was your inspiration for the verses? i LOVE it?","writing backwards is very hard, you usually just have to sit around all day until you get it. (by writing backwards i mean you already have the chorus but you need to figure out what comes before the chorus that is a good start but also makes the chorus work good after). and after stumbling for a bit i eventually got a first line i liked, and then went from there."
"If a girl were to tell her that she was extremely attracted to you and wanted to meet you, would you try to find out more or would you decline???","it would be great to get to know them, but that's not always reasonable to do on the questions page."

What made you want to create this website?,"because i already had made a lot of work and there was a steadily growing fan base out there who were basically just copying CDs for each other, and i really had no idea who they all were, so after trying and failing to collect some sort of email contact list to send the new stuff to, i quickly realized that it would be much better it i just put post it all somewhere, that way people can find it at their convenience without me having to find and chase everyone individually via email, and also more and more people could find it who i could never otherwise reach."
View on Donald Trump?,he is one of a kind.
i downloaded the outside video and noticed it's actually in 1080p. how did making the video larger/cleaner looking contribute to the length of this project?,"i've been using that resolution for at least a year and a half. i've actually always worked at 1920x1080 but in the past i have exported at 1136x639 because i am concerned that on a laptop web browser, by default some don't zoom to fit, so larger videos might be off the edge. that reminds me, i didn't get a chance to export that version of outside for the website, i actually need to switch it."
why is the i'm feeling randy button in he corner not clickable?,i don't know but it is.
"now that outside is out, i must ask: over what time period was this song written? how done was it when you tasked yourself to made the song& video?","the title line came from a writing session last march. then it was picked in august, and i wrote the rest and recorded it, and made the video after that."

"Hi I just asked the question about sharps, flats and naturals. I guess the altered note in one clef but not the other would never really come up because you'd just change the scale degree.. like if you had a C7#9 or whatever you'd never write the #9 note as Eb, you'd write it as D# so that way you don't have an E and Eb)...","that's true but there are some situations when it gets really dense when you might need F and F# at the same time. let's say if you are scoring a horror movie or something you might even need them in the same octave because you have F, F#, G all mashed together. i honestly have no idea how you would notate that. it is rare and only in extremely dissonant 'horror' type situations."
but I'm not really asking you about the sharp/flat rules.. I'm more just curious about my system.,
"9.27.1712:52 am yeah I know that Chris Farley was the one who wrote the lyrics, but are the chords that you used to to accompany the singing also his?",no. all i had to work with was what can be heard in the movie.
"btw sorry if I was messing up words, english is not my native language?","ah, right.... melody actually just means the notes he sang. not any of the chords or other notes that support."
"When I write down music, I always get confused about sharps, flats and natural symbols. Like if you have a note outside of the key signature and you put a flat,sharp or natural symbol on it, by the next measure are you supposed to assume that if that same note has no symbol then it's back to normal? Or if the note is altered in one clef, but not the other, do I put a sharp/flat/natural symbol on just the one clef and leave the other one unaltered?",in situations like that i think courtesy accidentals are very important.
"What if there's a modulation, do I put the new key signature in the middle of the score, or do I just adjust the sharps and flats accordingly?","if it stays there for a significant amount of time, then put a new key signature."
My strategy is just to write everything as if it's in the key of C.,"that is sometimes called an 'open key' and it is mainly used when it's just so all over the place it's not worth putting a key signature. i used an open key for a video where i transcribed and harmonized spoken language, as music. no sense putting a key because it was all over the place. but most 'reasonable' music should have a key signature."
"Notes that are sharp I write the sharp symbol, notes that are flat I write the flat sumbol. I never write the natural symbol, and if a note is played with a sharp or flat multiple times in the same bar, I write the symbol each time (instead of just once). This works fine for me, because usually the only per son who reads my sheet music is me. And this system makes sense to me.... but is this a bad strategy if I were to share my music with other people?Like if I were to write something out for some horn players or a piano player or whatever, would this system throw them off do you think?","yes. accidentals last at least until the end of the bar. i always thought there was disagreement about whether or not they last until the end of the line. but they definitely last at least until the end of the bar, and you should not be repeating the symbol if the note stays that way within the same bar, and therefore you need a natural to specify if it changes back. and if it changes back right at the beginning of the next bar, probably use a courtesy natural just in case. if it's in different octaves i think the rules become a little more ambiguous and courtesies are good, i'm not sure of the exact rules when it's different octaves."
"So the story goes (if I remember correctly) that god created adam, then sometime afterwards created eve from one of adam's ribs... when god created animals, did god create only male animals, then created the females from the male's ribs?

"If you have to perform along to a song you've heard only once, which instrumental part (vocals included) do you think you could remember the best and confidently play?","every song is different. in many cases the drums have the least to worry about because they don't have to really learn the chord changes. however, there are many songs where drummer crucially needs advanced knowledge of the road map, breaks, hits, kicks, etc. although this is reasonably easy to memorize by counting. chord changes can be very easy to memorize if you have a large familiarity with common music, and the song is relatively normal. the vocals would usually be by far the hardest to immediately get, due to lyrics."
Do you create better work when you are under strict guidelines set by someone else or when you have total freedom?,"guidelines set by someone else does not work for me. total freedom is insane to deal with, and setting guidelines for myself is confusing and challenging. but otherwise nothing will happen and i would explode. which i did for quite some time until eventually figuring it out."
"in new cannan you show little regard to time and space,?",that's not true.
"getting both the time of the day of your trip and the destination wrong. on this page, however, you have expressed your appreciation of the time-space continuum multiple times. thoughts on that?","without time and space, the journey never would have existed. the song would not have existed. and you would not exist and neither would i. there are many ways to use time, and one of the best ways is by telling stories and being creative."

Do you ever get annoyed when the comment section on one of your videos is full of hire a samurai and that's the way I like to live my life?,no but what does annoy me is questions that start with does it annoy you when... this whole question format is destructive and borders on harassment.

How do I know if there are infinite numbers? Has anyone ever counted all numbers from 0 to infinity to check that there are none missing?,when you count numbers you make them up. so i don't know if that's really a valid proof. but numbers are made up any way so i guess it is.

"at the current rate you're posting anagrams, when will you be catching up with the anagrams you made most recently?","maybe about 2 months. but i actually haven't made any new ones for at least a month. that's because i have a huge surplus, and i have a much much smaller surplus of tweets. so i have been focusing on writing tweets in the time when i might do anagrams (or tweets). if my surplus of tweets becomes larger than the surplus of anagrams, then i will do more anagrams. and i will continue to post both on a daily basis."

"Ever since I learned about the Maj7 chord I've never gone back to using just the major triad by itself anymore, unless it's part of a slash chord. Then when I learned about the Maj9 chord, I've never gone back to the Maj7 chord.

"writing the music is the real fun part for me, just laying down the chords and instrumentation. i like it! but 40 instrumental songs later, it feels like i'm in the same place as when i began--my skills are better, but i haven't gotten to say anything, and i need to move forwards. i've made 3 songs with words, and it's important. they were good, except recording vocals drives me crazy so the production value on that is subpar.you've really gotta have words if you wanna be clear and specific in your meaning. but lyrics only come to me sometimes, one idea at a time, and in between i'm left drifting. again, putting words to music is some of the most fun i've had making anything. but i really don't know how to just get jumpstarted at will. how can i conquer this?","i'm not sure, but it's important to remember that lyrics and music help each other. in other words, if you are good with music, which i suspect you are because you've been doing it along time, theoretically you could probably get away with making any lyric sound good. so try random starting places, like random word generators or something, as a starting point, and then make it a challenege to see if you can make it work."

"Choose the things you do according to the beat of a rhythm or a purpose? Then bounce around that theme randomly to try to explore all possibilities and find unexpected ways to express yourself? Listening to your music has made me start to act this way, and I think I like it, although I'm still being cautious. If your art has this effect on me, I wonder what effect the other media I consume has on my mental and emotional equilibrium. I want to use this realization as an excuse to control my mental faculties and inputs, while I also try to remind myself that if I fall too deep down that hole I will miss out on some really cool/interesting shit. Sometimes you've gotta experience the universe, sometimes you've gotta think about it, but whichever you're doing right now you should do it in a way that builds it for the future AND enjoys the present.",

WHY IS LIFE SO HARD?","A7 usually won't have F unless it is marked A+7, or if F is in the melody. also when in doubt, in 7th chords just stick to the 2 notes that form a tritone. so in E7 that's D and G#. and when in doubt play them in the octave around middle C."

"Sometimes I feel as if I am but a trespasser. One who observes and tries to watch and understand, but does not contribute. The universe placates me into complacency and boredom through shallow joys and entertainments. My friends placate each other to avoid negative emotions. Best to do nothing at all than to risk doing something bad. But a deep part of my soul stirs itself and yearns for more. I'm thinking of running away from this toxic environment and learning to play an instrument or some sort of art or something-anything- to contribute to the beauty around me. But I'm scared to take the first step. Beaten into being afraid of making even the smallest misstep. Afraid of the unknown. I want to dive into the universe rather than stay as a passive observer, but I still don't understand it well enough to find a path on my own. And I don't want to follow the footsteps of another, or I will be constantly comparing myself to them and replacing my old rules and rigidity with a new set.

"I heard this really good description of time in the form of a riddle from my musical mentor. He asked me let's say you are rafting on a river. There are slow parts and fast parts. So if the fast part is going faster than the slow part, then why isn't there a gap in between the fast and slow parts where there isn't any water? and I knew how rivers worked so I told him the size of the river changes and he was like yes! That's how good time works! it can speed up or slow down, but there is always the same amount of 'water', and when people aren't very good at keeping time, there are these wedges in the river where there is empty space. I love this analogy but I still don't fully understand the water part in terms of music. Do you have any ideas?",i actually don't understand the analogy.

"Hi. So the earth completes 1 rotation in 24 hours. That's 1/86400 seconds which is about 0.00001157407 Hz. Move that up a few octaves (22) and you pretty much got a G note. Using the same math... I found that Mercury and Venus are both closest to A. Earth and Mars are closest to G. Jupiter is closest to Bb. Saturn is closest to A. Uranus is closest to C#. Neptune is closest to D. So our solar system is playing, like a Gm9#11 chord? Why such a sad, weird, dissonant chord do you think? Why does our solar system feel like that? Pluto would be closest to B... which would make the chord even weirder.... I don't even know what you'd name that chord. Maybe this is why scientists don't want to make pluto a planet???","it's important to remember that those frequencies are not close enough in tune to warrant calling it the chord you called it. some of them are really like half way in between notes. i think if you are interested in what it sounds like, you will need to try putting all those frequencies together (multiplied up several octaves of course) and hear what it sounds like."
thoughts on long answers to short questions?,seems legit.

"i'm taking a class on classical music theory (fwiw i am a self-taught musician and the reason why i'm in this class is complicated) and i realized a lot of the infinitely long rules for common practice can be followed like 90% of the time if you just move the voices as little as possible, as alluded to in 9.9.179:47 am . is this a coincidence or is there something magical and/or pragmatic about moving the voices as little as possible?","i think it's kind of like how people usually remain in roughly the same geographical location, over the course of one sentence. although that is not always the case."
"Hi! I'm working on some short stories. Can you tell me what you think is the best way to write the contraction of why did you? I want to write my dialogue the way that people actually talk. At least me personally, I never enunciate all 3 of those words, I say it like it's 1 word,that sounds like wide'juh if that makes sense.

I think making them after making the nearly 400 songs is a good time.","there is a page on my site where i just jam out on cover songs, instrumentally. this is mainly for my own enjoyment, but you can hear it anyway. beyond that, i find if i'm actually constructing a good instrumental, it should go along with a video."

"I have a hard time coming up with vocal parts. And singing is especially difficult for me. I've had asthma since I was a kid, and other recurring respiratory issues.. so sometimes it's tough to hold out a note for a long time, or to sing a full phrase without having to stop to take a breath, I think it might limit my vocal range too. When I do try and sing, I sound like ifDonald Fagen smoked way too many cigarettes and put a clothespin on his nose. I love music, and I like to think that I am pretty decent on the instruments I play, but so many songs are driven by the vocal parts. Like, I think really the function of instruments in a song is to compliment/accompany the vocals (which should usually be front and center)... Not really singing makes it tough for me to actually come up with vocal parts, so I try to over-compensate with the instruments when I write. But when I do play with a singer, usually there's too much going on with the instrumental arrangements and it sounds too jumbled/cluttered. Any advice for me?",it sounds like you are on the right track.

(Probably piano because you've talked about it before but I might as well ask :p)?",i think learning both together will be great for you.

"Man! I want to say thank you for being so dedicated with this questions page and your reality page, it's super generous and it has seriously inspired me to let go of fears and try new things. I feel happy and like I'm making progress with my creativity largely thanks to you. I do have a question though, I have two main passions, one is music, songwriting and production (which is already like 10 passions in one), and the other is sustainable food/permaculture/natural building/saving the world which is another several passions and my skills there are still so underdeveloped. I ideally I would love to connect the two but can't see how. Do you think it's totally unrealistic to pursue both of these very different fields simultaneously?",i think you can find a way.
It's what's freaking me out most at the moment. I know you might not be able to help but I respect your opinion. Thanks again.,

"Have you ever thought about writing a book about your journey as a content creator some day? I think it would be really helpful for new, aspiring creators?","nowadays, books aren't necessarily the most efficient way to store and deliver information, but my journey has been heavily documented, and the documentation process is ongoing, and i will continue to release more and more pieces of autobiographical material as they become available, as i have done in the past."
"do you write all your songs out as charts before creating the audio, like you did with 'the road' which you posted on here?","yes, although i don't use physical paper any more, per se."
"i'm a superfan, but here's something that bugs me about you. you insist that other people cant be involved in the creation of your art, but thats a false claim.",thank you for the update.
"you treat this very questions page as a piece of art (which is to say, you make it exactly like you like it, exercising artistic judgement in its very existence, creating something truly beautiful and worth paying attention to) and the page's existence is entirely dependent on others -- harnessing their curiosity. I think you're just being defeatist to rule out all collaboration when you have demonstrated on some level that it is within your grasp.","perhaps some of the people you call defeatist have actually tried many times, and many ways, while you weren't watching."
"if anyone can come up with a game plan and a system of ensuring the collaboration is designed in such a way that it results in Desired User Experience, then it's you, and i'm saying that because you figured out the much harder puzzle of becoming unconfused about how to make anything at all. you lament the slowness of your production but rule out th e most p otent soltion instead of making it work for you, with cleverness and ingenuity. manhours are what you need to get the workrate you crave, and, right now, there are more untapped manhours at your disposal out there in the world than you have left in your entire life. ruling out the option of collaboration strikes me as so unlike your philosophy of there being so many shades of gray in every issue and challenge.",it's important to remember that that was my first choice.

"Any general tips for writing parts for two chord-playing instruments (like piano& guitar, or 2 guitars)?","that's kind of a trick question because often when writing for those 2 instruments you might want 1 to play chords and the other not. but if they are both playing chords they should be playing the same chords. at least the core of the harmony should be the same, and most importantly in the same octave. they will blend nicely together."

"bill i need help finding a good chord to continue a section of a song. It's on acoustic guitar but it's the top 4 strings so it's almost ukelele sounding. It goes A major with the root doubled in the G and high E strings, to Amaj7 to A7 to the chord i'm trying to find. Nothing about the chords are changing other than the descending chromatic scale on the high E string, so this next unknown chord would have F# in it. I'm thinking F#m add 11 omit 5 / A.","yeah you want D. then prob Dmin, then A(over C# in the bass if you prefer), then B7, then E7. and loop back. i mean i think you should write according to what the song is about and what it's used for, but i have a feeling this is what you're looking for. the D for sure. after that it's your choice."

They've learned some basic chords but I don't know where to go from there with them.",teach them popular songs that everybody knows! put it in a good key where they can play it using the chords they know. if you tell me what chords they know and what song you wanna do i can tell u what key you'll need.
How do you come up with a good bassline?,start by just playing the root of the chord when each chord first occurs. you may think that's way too simple but you also may immediately think of something that is one step cooler. and just go from there.
what chord is being played at 1:12 here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp1yaEbIfl8&t;=72?,"play Emaj triad and throw in A# note and you'll be all set. for the folks at home that's notes E, G#, A#, B. real thick. double the octaves. it's a large ensemble."

I know that I'll be working with other people for the rest of my life in my chosen career path, and I find it impossible to make friends (my only friend was someone I met on a film forum ten years ago) so essentially, how do I navigate this? I hate drawing negative attention to myself but I feel I do that by being so quiet whenever I'm at work, even though I usually have nothing to contribute. It's often presumed something's wrong with me because I remain silent, but I feel absolutely fine most of the time and I'll be polite/reply when spoken to. I only really connect with someone if they have the same level of social ineptitude or have the same very specific and intense interests as me. Please, help a gal out.

"but, i'm finding producing is way more rewarding for me than writing and i struggle putting time into the writing of music. how to get motivated to work in the hard part?","i'm not sure. i have the opposite problem, i am more interested in the writing. but i'm also extremely particular about the sound, because the sound delivers the writing. so i can't exactly just give that to someone else. i'm sorry that does not answer your question."

"sometimes you don't have to pay people for them to make professional work. it depends on the person actually but there are other people out there who just want to express themselves by doing what they do best, i believe.","right, but their commitment will be dependent on delicate factors, such as how your personal relationship with them might be going."

"i need to be alone to be able to write anything, so poems, lyrics, stories and such are not a problem but scripts ... plays i have to direct and movies/shows i plan to make in the future feels like attaching rocks to my  feet an d letting my originality sink because, you know, people. now if i don't like something i can just change it or get on the stage and perform myself but what will happen when things get more and more serious?","you will have to work your way up. i am just barely even beginning to think about scratching the surface of various types of 'crew' solutions. but in my model, people need to be paid if you really want to expect them to do work and spend time, consistently, whether it's monday or friday."

"the first play took long and it consumed me but everything was good, i never thought i will do it again. i don't think it's about compromising, i was expecting that. i know i am the director and everything is under my control, just like i wanted. i really don't understand why.",

Since I'm sure you've already thought of this, I wanted to ask why this isn't a solution: Why not categorize your sounds, and when you need, for example, a bass sound that hasn't come up yet, you just pick a random bass sound?",one of the most magical things about the randomization system is that it forces you to realize all the ways that instruments can be used for a different category than you expected.
Did gaining a bigger audience make you more picky about your new content?,"no, but gaining better skills raised my expectations."
i want to make music so bad but i just don't fucking know how and it feels like i'm being buried alive by all the possibilities and i was late to the game in terms of experimenting and i feel like i will never acquire the skills i need at this rate?,"no one knows how. there is no way to write music. other than the way each person makes up on their own. you might even have an interesting advantage because you don't think you know anything. but either way, you have to try something first. it's like untying a knot which is trapped in a block of ice. you are not going to even touch the knot until you break the damn ice. to break the ice, just hit it with something large, anywhere on the exterior. anywhere, it doesn't matter. or if you prefer to just raise the tempurature of the room that might do it."
"Ya know how music is all like, Hey bud, you can write me, but you better write me bad a lot until you write me good, and then you're like, no, i wanna write you good right now, and music say, nah, bud, it's gotta be bad. Later it can be good, but be bad right now, and you say,  fine, whatever, and then you make music and it is always bad and then you are like, when will it get good, and then music is all like, it doesn't. It is always bad, and that's really good, and then you're like, that makes no fucking sense what are you talking about, and music says, well, I was just thinking that maybe I could, like, inspire you by saying that music is bad and you've been making bad music so I'm just trying to show that, like, if you make the music bad it is good or something, and then there's a long pause and then you're like, I'm gonna make good music now, and music says, fine whatever.

Or Ill see somebody playing the entire rite of spring or something on piano without any music in front of them. Do you think being able to memorize long and intracite, detailed pieces of music is a skill that you can improve upon over time?

"hey Bill, i just read your update on the new project and how you are looking for faster ways to make videos. This is a very relevant issue for me as well, and i have some ideas that might be of use... i started out making everything in After Effects (i dont know what software you use but this should be relevant regardless) which is great and amazing but non efficient especially when you have a identity of textures and tones that is some kind of starting point and a through line through all your different projects but reusing previous stuff from other After Effects projects feels werid and is not ideal. i have recently been learning a coding language called Processing which i am using to create programs to execute visuals before i bring them into After Effects. For a a hopefully relevant example to you, i could make a program where i can type in text, have a rgb slider for base color of text, create duplicates of text on top of one another with differ ent colo rs and choose a display style like a repeating pattern of text or a silly wobble distortion or something. Then i can save the text as a picture or video and then do the polishing in After Effects. These little programs you can make for various reasons and reused without loosing freshness or constraints as you can easily add a few parameters to the code for every projects adding on to the base you have built up which you can execute and use immediately. The beginning of this process is the worst by far and takes time but it seems to me like the efficiency ratio is a constant upward line with no plateauing and from your knowledge of html from making this website, i think the starting momentum would not be too terribly slow. this might be helpful to you, thank you for changing the world all the time?",i would like to talk more about this! have you checked out my email address on the email page of this site.

IT IS A PLANT!!!! >:(?","describe what it does for the story. if you are having trouble, try deleting the plant from the story, and figure out what's different. or, as another approach, try to imagine a different way that the plant could be which would make the story different. then re-set to the way the plant is, and that might give you a better picture of what needs to be mentioned, when talking about the plant and what it's doing for the story. i mean it's gotta do something for the story otherwise it wouldn't be there. or who knows, maybe it shouldn't be there, in which case maybe you could make that argument."

"Hi, just wondering what's up with the new vid?I know (as always) you are working as hard and fast and as you can, and I'm sure the song and video will be awesome.. But, I'm wondering if there's something you're stuck on, or if you hit a particular obstacle or something like that? Sorry, don't mean to be rude or to ask one of those WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG!?!? questions... I just hope everything's going smoothly?","all things considered, i really haven't done that many full length songs with videos. actually, all things considered, i really haven't even done that many full length songs in audio either. i have done several, but still not that many. in many ways i am still refining my techniques. there are other things that distracted me as well. the first week after movie star was released, i did several reality clips, because i was intending to release them daily, so i had to catch up on about 9 clips. that took about a week. then i had a lot of trouble really figuring out what direction to go next. i have a strong desire to do only songs (with videos) forever. but free videos (non-song videos) are important too. i ultimately decided to stick with songs. then came the next challenge, which is a demon i've been battling forever regarding song selection. how the hell do i choose what song to do? and do i use randomization or not? this issue has been destroying me for many years, and i can never get my head around it. it seems like every song is good because there is something bad about it. it's like movies -- every story is good because there is something bad about it -- it gives the characters something to overcome. there's so many different types of songs that are each a different way for a different reason, and the only thing that makes sense is to do them ALL. i've gotten very experimental with songwriting, and written a lot of weird shit. i've also had the desire to write much much more 'normal' sounding stuff. i have a lot of both. Any individual choice for what the next song is always feels totally wrong. like, oh no i can't do that one, it's too weird. or, oh no that one's too normal. or, oh no, that one's too this, or too that. The bottom line is, every song is a certain way, and it's like people, every person has a unique way that they are, and every single person is unlikeable in some way, but that's what makes them likeable. picking just one song has always been completely impossible, and every time i have to just give up and use brute force randomization. which means i just put all the choices in a huge list (usually hundreds long) and use the computer to pick a random number and do that one. this can be good, but also scary, and it really picks songs that sometimes maybe i shouldn't have done. crazy/raining was picked this way, and i just don't think i would have picked such a lonely/mopey ballad if i had had my own choice. free to was picked this way, and i guess it was an ok choice. california was picked this way, and it is a fun song, but for fucks' sake if i was choosing it manually, why would i pick another weed song? i've already referenced 'getting high' enough. people are gonna think i'm obsessed with weed now. cuz i love you, again, another choice that i never would have made manually, and i was scared to do it after it was picked, but luckily i was able to completely re-write the verses to make it work. movie star and got to know what's going on were also random choices, but i felt more comfortable with those, especially because they were only 10% written, so i got to finish the writing in whatever way i was comfortable with in the current time. but there are just so many songs in that list that are just so not the right ones to do yet. i really really want to do them all, but it is always impossible to choose one. But it seems that if i actually can make the right choice then it seems i will increase my chances of getting a good final product that i think is really strong and great, and right for the time. so this time i took another shot at it. i started going through the list, and making note of certain ones that i thought should be 'in the running' for selection ... and i started creating like a ranking list, as i was going through, i was keeping track of which one was my first choice, second choice, etc etc. it took me a long time to work through the list, and i didn't even finish the list before i realized, again, as always, that this is never going to work. i realized i was ignoring songs that are barely written, for some reason. and i was excluding ones that i was nervous about, but actually would be great choices if i could just follow through without questioning. so i think after several days on this system, i somehow got the idea for a hybrid system, where i just go through the list, and tab any ones that i definitely do NOT want picked right now, to the side. this was actually very quick. i actually excluded more than i thought, which was a little risky because it was very similar to the previous all-manual system, but i got through very quickly, and out of the list of 400 i got it down to about 41. my plan was to then make a random pick out of those 41. but i was really nervous about it, and i knew if i got a pick that i hated i would hate the whole system again and be lost again. so i actually went through those 41 again, and really took out ones that i just thought weren't right. and i got it down to 27. THEN i finally made the random selection, out of those 27. the song that came up was just fine, and a good pick. but i think it would have not been picked in manual mode, because it was barely written (just like a one word chorus/hook) and i don't think it would have made the rankings as a 'favorite' because i couldn't really have any strong feelings about it yet, because the majority of the 'meat' had not yet been written. but thanks to the random/hybrid system, it never got excluded from the legit candidates list, because i do think it is a perfectly strong hook and there was nothing wrong with it, and it can easily be written into something great. so i believe that was wednesday aug, 23 that the pick was made. The next issue is just the issue of schedule, and time, and productivity. I have been desperately been trying to find ways to increase production speed by, well, i dunno, 1000%? for many years now. it has been an ongoing problem that what i do takes so much longer than i want it to. so i made a bold goal in saying that i need to have these song+videos done in 2 weeks, and release them every other tuesday. during june of this year i was roughly able to stay afloat on a 1-week per song schedule, that was with the audio only. however, doing a video for a full length song, while i haven't done that many, it has always taken somewhere around 4 weeks or more, just for the video. that was true of crazy/raining, free to, movie star, etc. And this particular song is longer than all of those, it's 3:29. so really, 2-weeks for both audio and video is outlandish. But i keep holding on to the idea that there are always more undiscovered ways of doing graphics that are drastically faster, and still interesting. it's a goal i've been chasing for many years, and i can never seem to reach it, but i still keep believing it's possible. because i've just got so much material left to do, it just needs to happen drastically faster than it is. one key thing i keep coming back to is how i started making videos in the first place. originally i had no idea how to do it, and i thought video making in general was way over my head, but i knew that there always has to be a way to express myself even just using the most simple tools and techniques. and if you look at the first few videos i was doing, throughout 2013 and early 2014, it is clear that i barely knew anything except how to put words on the screen at the right time. but the point is, i knew that you can always express yourself just fine no matter how limited your tools are. so that is my main beacon of light nowadays in terms of trying to drastically reduce production time -- i always keep coming back to this idea that it must be possible to still have a good fun time in videos, with 90% less work than i've been doing. it's a goal that i just can't and won't let go of. So anyway, the pipedream for this project was 2 weeks for the whole damn thing, writing, audio, video. that would put the release date to tues, sep 5. so i got straight to writing, the writing was done in about 3 days, and i think it came out great. very glad, and very happy with the choice. so i put down extremely temp audio, with the right timing and tempo, and jumped into the video. tried to move as fast as i could, although really i was only putting down sort of a very basic layer of what happens, and knew that i really needed to go back through and spice everything up (i did this with movie star). approaching friday before the tuesday deadline, i was basically only about 50% through the video, on the most absolute basic level, so that means there was still a huge amount of work to do. but i knew i needed to get to the audio, especially because there is a delay on that, if i want it to get to itunes/spotify in time for the release, it actually needs to be done and sent 2 days in advance. so i went to the audio .... but then, more demons. i just felt really stuck in a rut, like i've been using the same sounds forever, and i've been wrestling with these instrument randomization methods which work really really well but there's always flaws in the system. i first started using this type of method in 2015 or so-- the basic idea is you randomly select a sound from all your sounds, just pick it entirely randomly, and then you get to decide where in the song it fits. so even if you pick something totally stupid that you think you can never use, if you search through the song, verse, chorus, all the parts of the song, you can always find a certain place that it works. and the result is, when you are listening to the song, you hear these things that are really fresh, and they all sound like the right sound for that point in time. but you never had to go through any effort searching for a sound that would fit. instead, you randomly picked the sound, and searched for where it fit. this was a huge breakthrough i had in early 2015, and i've used this random system for any long song i've done ever since. it works great and produces really interesting results very quickly and effortlessly, and it seems like it eliminates the need to worry or even think. you just keep doing instrument picks, and dropping them into where you think they go, and just keep going, instrument after instrument, until eventually the song is full. But unfortunately, this system starts to fail, sort of like an exponential curve, as the song gets about 75% full, you start running out of places to put things, and yet some of the main important pieces will remain still un-picked. like real basic stuff, like the HH for the verse. or the bass for the chorus. so the question is always, when is it time to abandon the random system and just use normal judgement, pick an ordinary bass sound, and just play the part. But for some reason i have real serious problems just using 'ordinary judgement.' especially on long songs. i just can't seem to do it, i'm so burned out on decision making, and i'm also so scared to make 'ordinary choices', and i'm just so aware that i need to keep things very fresh. and yet, another part of me wants to think only from a writers perspective, and life seems so much simpler when i'm just writing and not thinking about instruments. makes me wish i was just a solo acoustic guitar player/singer where all i have to do is just play the song and not worry about what it's made of, texturally. seems like writing the song is the main game i'm interested in here, and it is so draining to have to worry about the textures on top of that. seems counter-productive, almost like each skill is working to make up for flaws in the other, and when you have to care about both it kind of ruins the game. but, once i get into a good system, it can be really good and fun and can get great results, but what i'm saying is, over the last few years i've been kind of walking on eggshells trying to figure out how to balance the random and non. i keep desperately trying to find solid procedures, to avoid this lost feeling of having no idea what to do next. And i also figured it is really time for me to go out and find some new sounds, which is something i always say i'm gonna do but never do. so i cruised some sites and got a bunch of stuff, and also spent some money, and so basically i spent a whole day cruising for new sounds. this was saturday, sep 2. pretty clear that sep 5 is impossible at this point, but i was making progress on getting some new sounds, and i figured it would be useful. So the next question is, what the heck kind of randomization system am i using, how do i balance it with more 'reasonable' and simple choices, and how do i keep my head straight, and have a real solid procedure for this. i seemed really stuck again, but i very quickly had another huge breakthrough. i decided to pick 50 sounds, manually, and just keep it to those 50 only. this is way less than i usually would need if i was doing random picks, but when i'm doing random picks, as soon as it gets above 100, the computer starts flaking out and can't deal with it. and it's not efficient, because i would be picking like a percussion sound, which might be a whole percussion kit, and i would be only using a tiny shaker or tamborine in like 1 spot, and then picking another instrument entirely. so it's very wasteful, RAM wise, if you think about it. so i just decided i would pick 50 only, and for some reason i decided to pick manually. because i think i tried the same approach once before randomly, and i was stuck without any bass sounds, or something weird like that. so i picked them manually and made sure to spread it out so i had enough of each type. enough drum kits, enough basses, enough 'keyboard' type sounds, enough stringed type sounds, enough lead sounds, enough weird ?? sounds, etc, tried to keep it balanced. and chose mainly from the list of stuff i've made myself over the years, stuff which i've saved that i really like. including a lot of crazy sounds i made while working on history of the entire world. and i got all the choices in order from 1 to 50 so i could easily make random picks. and i just started doing it, picking a random number, and finding where the heck it goes. I also had the song broken up into sections, so each pick was actually an instrument and a section. so this helped ensure that i wasn't neglecting certain sections. i randomized long lists in advance, so i just checked the list to see what the numbers were. so 41, 10 means i have to take instrument 41, and go to section 10, and find a place for it. and pow, very very quickly the song got up to critical mass, and a lot of really special things were going into the song. Within just a couple days, it was about 75% full, with still many crucial things missing (kick or some sections, HH/perc missing for some parts, bass missing for some parts, chords missing for certain parts, etc etc) but generally it seemed the majority of the song was filled in. this was probably about mid-week, just after tues sep 5, so the initial (impossible) deadline had already failed, but i was still aiming for the following tuesday. again, a challenge presented itself as to how to know when to get off the random system, and when to just start finishing and making my own decisions and just filling in the essentials that are still missing. but i've just been so drained and in-a-rut about these issues that i was really careful about this and wanted to know what the solid procedure is. ultimately, what i've learned from this, is i've decided that it should be about 100 random picks per minute of song, because it was at about 350 picks that i really became sure that the random picking had saturated the song as much as it could, and some of the 'weirder' sounds had already come up so many times that any more would make them not sound unique anymore. so i think in the future, the idea is to let it get to 100 picks per minute of song (i.e. for a 3 minute song, the limit should be 300 picks) and then just jump to car-testing, troubleshooting. it's always good to ditch into troubleshooting early, even if you know it's terribly incomplete. i went to car testing extremely early on the 'movie star' song, just for the hell of it, because that one was actually on a week deadline, and while there were huge things missing, you just put the biggest issues into a list, then fix the list, then do it again. and believe it or not, i think it's never been more than 4 lists to completion, even when i ditch into car testing a bit early. so anyway, i went to troubleshooting, really planning to get it set by sunday morning, to have it sent out by then, and type in a deadline of tues (which means it's out of my hands and the stores would publish it on tues) and just create an outrageous externally imposed deadline to finish the video, which by the way still required a huge amount of work. but i just still wasn't done troubleshooting until later sunday/monday, and i just keep being more meticulous with this thing. because i just want it to be really good! so the mix was declared done on monday or so, but i still didn't want to send it until i was a little more sure that i could definitely finish the video within 2 days. Then, something else happened, i heard back from youtube about the content ID system, which is something that i've sought after for a long, long, time, which is the ability to monetize re-uploads of my videos on other peoples' channels. this is a very exclusive tool set that big youtube creators and companies have access too, which allows them to claim other peoples' videos when they infringe their copyrights, and either have them taken down, or, more often, just leave them up and have them monetized on that user's channel. this could be a big potential source of income, and for me, since i absolutely never put ads on my own channel, and i've always been slightly uncomfortable with people uploading censored verions, remixes, etc, (but still never wanted to police it or take it down cuz that's just mean) it would be a great way for me to actually earn some income without having to monetize on my own channel, if i just monetize all that stuff whenever other people re-upload it. it could mean the ability to actually really do this 100% full time, without having to work for anyone else, ever. and also maybe afford to move to a better studio, start actually playing drums in videos, get a faster computer, etc.. so i've been patiently trying to get access to this feature, but it's very very exclusive, and it's very hard to get it, and youtube has told me in the past that they weren't going to let me have it. but i recently heard back from someone who seems to be guiding me through the proper steps, so there's all these certifications i had to take, so THAT kept me occupied for a day or 2, then i finally got back to working on the video. and at this point, i've blown past multiple tuesdays since the original tuesday i had fantasized (however impossibly) about having it done, and i just ... again, i'm still desperate to have a breakthrough that makes this stuff 10 times faster and easier, and i am holding on to the hope that i can do that. and in the future i still think i can get it down to 2 weeks, for song+video. additionally, just in the last week or so i have started to think maybe i should still alternate between songs and non-songs. with either one hopefully being done in 2 weeks. anyway, so that is what's going on, and to be honest right now the video process is going very slowly. looking to have a similar breakthrough that i had the other week with the music, something that allows me to just blast through on simple-mode, and would allow me to easily keep things interesting, over the course of a 3 and a half minute song. i mean, what i do is not exactly run-of-the-mill. the reason i've acheived such great results is because i kind of have a standard of making things as good as i possibly can. if i had just not cared, i don't think i would be where i am today, and gotten the results i've gotten. not to mention, making full videos for 3-minute-plus songs is something that i have still only done a relatively low number of times, and in addition, i always need to make sure that i am pushing things to new heights and challenging peoples' expectations, which again is one of the staple elements that has brought me to where i am today. so yes i am desperately looking for ways to make things 10 times faster, but also while preserving the ability to make each moment, and the whole product, mind-meltingly special, if i possibly can."

How did you make the first person in I'm a person hit so hard?,"i dunno. just hit the chord, with the bass, and the kick, at the right time, with everything at the right volume. that's all there is to it. and a little background voc harmonies probably set to a low enough level that you can't hear it but it strengthens the chord. and a touch of reverb on the background vocals and probably the lead as well."
"I think I kind of understand your system now of using random number generators to decide what to work on. But when you were starting out, how did you generate song topic ideas and decide which ones were worth actually writing?","there was a point where i was so desperate i knew i just needed to try anything. because i knew i could find good songs from any starting point, and i needed some practice anyway. so a lot of my early songs were either about the desire to write songs, or maybe just complete nonsense, or at least they start with complete nonsense, but the good news is i found that if you let your guard down and use the nonsense in the first few lines, it often transforms easily into something meaningful for the next part. by the way, i never used randomization to decide how to start a song. i've only used it to decide which songs to finish, record, and release."

"others don't complete my work. i don't care whoever is it, i never would let someone do that, it's MINE. i just tell people what to do. but to stage something there are other people i have to work with, the people who made me write the script and who will probably cut some scenes out. it seems it's my only choice right now, to work with them or anyone else who is able to cut until i'm ready to take bigger and faster steps. i actually want to do it on my own, right now and i'm still trying to figure out how to do such a thing alone (and i'm open to any suggestion from you). i think writing anything is meant to be done alone and i do it that way because it's the best one but shooting a film or performing a play... i really have to work with a crew (and with some people outside the crew) unless we are talking about an online monologue video here. so yeah i'm not completely free at the moment but one day i will be, i have just begun. what i'm saying is,  i don't  rely on others to complete my work, it's more like i command them. you definitely should try this. even if 'they' are the people i told you about, i'm the one who is in the driver's seat and i wouldn't write the script if i wasn't. letting them cut stuff is compromising, because i know the script i've written is risky, and daring.","right, i agree with all of this. and i do hope to do that stuff some day. the only thing is if you really want to tell a bunch of people what to do, you need to be at a reasonably high standing in society. meaning you need to be able to pay everyone adequately, at least if you want professional quality work. and if you can't afford to pay them, you have to always worry about whether they want to keep working with you, and you will be walking on eggshells, perhaps afraid to give the kind of serious direction you might want to give. Working completely alone is a different thing. it means you can't use actors, you can't have camera operators, .... you are limited to entirely different mediums, like animation, etc. and that is very hard work. like i said, it depends on your level of difficulty in working with others. if you really really can't do it (like i can't) then it might be worth it to re-imagine your entire career around things you can do yourself. at least until you have more resources. nowadays you can get further than ever working alone."

pls help bill what are the time signatures in i wanna be a movie star? i've been struggling to discover it but it's so difficult and?,"the main hook/chorus is 4+5 (alternating 4, and 5.) the verse goes 4, 5, 4, 5, 3, 3, 6 (i know you may think it makes no sense to use 3's and 6's both, but that's just the way i think of it. you could break any of these up any way you want) and the second half of the first verse is the same BUT, i can't remember, there might be an extra beat at the end of the verse, so the second time around might be 7 or 6. i remember there was some discrepancy here, different ones felt like they needed to be different ways. i haven't heard it since it was released. the end of each verse might be either 6 or 7, you'll have to count yourself, i haven't heard it since it was released and i'm not listening to it now. The chorus right before the bridge is cut short, so that entire chorus would be 4, 5, 4, 5, 4, 5, 4, 3. The bridge is 6, 7, 6, 4, 7 (you could break this up in many different ways. also not totally sure about what the hang time is on the end of the bridge, i don't remember for sure) all these times are expressed in terms of quarter notes. so when i say 5 that means 5/4."

Now that Vine has gone away, it seems it only shows the most popular ones.","i actually thought vine was gone, but recently i wanted to link to my Q train video, and wanted the looping version, so i went to vine and it looks like all the videos are still there, in the original uploaded order. but maybe i'm wrong. regardless, every video i made for vine was first made in wide screen, as a regular video, and posted on my website and youtube. so every video can still be found in those 2 locations, even though it maybe a different aspect ratio, a few seconds longer, and may not auto-loop. aside from that, i still have all the square vine versions, and i'm considering making a page on this site that for all the vine versions."
"Hi, I'm the Pandora person. So I actually read through their 25 page manual and everything they had on their website about music submissions, and it seems like your music is more likely to be accepted if you submit it through one of their direct deal partners.

"Hello, my name is Jeff Caan. I don't know if you like posting questions where people say there names,but in this case, I don't mind. You have my permission. My name has caused me a lot of annoyance over the years. With my last name being Caan I've had to deal with SO many people yelling Khaaaaaaaaaaan! (like from Star Trek), also, I've lost count of the times where I've had to tell people that no, I am not Shao Kahn from Mortal Kombat or Shere Khan from Jungle Book. I'm also not related to James Caan or Madeline Kahn. And in the past couple of years, I don't think I need to tell you how people react whenever I say My name is Jeff..... I would like to use your question page as an opportunity to give a PSA to all those who read these questions. DO NOT MAKE JOKES ABOUT SOMEBODY'S NAME. THEY HAVE HEARD THE JOKE BEFORE COUNTLESS TIMES. YOU ARE NOT ORIGINAL, AND THEY DO NOT THINK IT IS FUNNY. If somebody's name is Jesse don't say Ha! Tha t's a gi rls name! If somebody's name is Duncan, don't call them Duncan Donuts. If somebody's name is Richard, yes, they know that Dick is short for Richard and that dick can mean penis. If somebody's shares the same last name as a celebrity or a character from a tv show/movie/book, don't ask them if they are related to that person/character. If somebody's first and last name rhyme or if they have two first names, you don't have to point that out for them. They know.",

if 8th-notes are 1&2& how do you prefer to count 16th-notes out loud?,"i use the 1e&a2e;&a; system, although it's not really used for actually counting consecutive 16th notes, it's more like an address system, to refer to a point in time. like you might tell your trumpet players to play the hit on the e of 2 that means it's the second 16th note of beat 2. similar to how you might say on the & of 2 which would mean halfway in between beat 2 and 3."

"I saw your harmony tip of don't play chords in the bass? Do you mean don't play chords below a certain register, or don't play full chords with your left hand? Cause a lot of times when I play piano I do chords with my left, melody with my right. Should I break this habit?","don't play chords below a certain register. but the whole reason is because it doesn't sound good, so if you think it sounds good then great news you don't have to obey this rule."
"I have a lot of music written. Some of its fully recorded, some it's partially recorded, some it's just written out in paper. But, I have a good solid base of stuff to go off of. But right now, I'm stuck in a MAJOR rut. Like, what do I do with all this music? The logical thing I think would be pairing music with videos, graphics, or some kind of visual aspect. But the thing is, I've never really felt the calling of being a video-maker. It's not really something I'm passionate about at all, in the same way I am about making music... and if im not passionate about it, why even do it? Even if I do decide to at least try making videos, I have no experience in it and wouldn't even know where to begin... Also, I feel like just making videos for the sake of pairing something up with my music isn't a good strategy since it would just be like forcing 2 things together instead of creating something with sound and visuals together that go hand and hand as pa rt of a whole. I have some songs that I think can stand alone, like more traditional verse/chorus stuff with vocals... but most of my stuff is like weird little instrumental pieces, like 10 seconds to a minute in length, which I don't think would make much sense on their own (when I wrote them I had certain images in mind, like this song reminds me of a mad scientists tinkering with a bunch of test-tubes and bubbling chemicals, this song sounds like you just got game over in a video game, this song sounds like you just had an idea and a light bulb went off over your head, this song sounds like your taking a walk and then something crazy jumps out in front of you, this one sounds like you tried to do something epic but then failed in an anticlimactic way at the very end, etc)... sorry for this long rambling text. But I just feel like I've been standing in front of the same hurdle for a very long time and have no ideas how to jump over it and it's disheartening. If you have any advi ce for m e, I'd really appreciate it. Like should I just force myself to try to learn how to make videos, and hope that over time I learn to enjoy it, get better at it, and find my own voice/style? Or should I seek alternate routes (which routes, I don't know) that don't involve me making videos?","well, if you really don't want to find any way to make videos but you feel like the material has to go with something visually (which i think is probably right) then you might consider finding someone else who wants to make the videos. or, another approach would be to find people that make videos and they are looking for music, and you could write music to their videos. neither of these options work for me because i am a control freak and i live under a rock. but because of that, i knew i had no choice but to learn how to make the videos myself. but if you don't want to do that you might try to explore some collaborative options."

"i didn't mean that one hour long play script is one of the small steps. it's not a huge step for me but it definitely was a critical step that would help me take bigger steps forward. and i have no idea how i managed to do it either. after i took your advicei thought this is what i want to do, this is what i do best, what stops me? i can't take doing nothing anymore. and i started to note every little and crazy idea for anything, being reckless about if it's perfect for other people's standards. i travelled and wrote poems in those places. i tried to play guitar for the first time in years, it seems i need to dust off my old skills but ... i wrote lyrics, i guess? i had many, many, many fiction ideas for novels and i gained experience for non-fiction.and i did everything on a small scale. THEN i jumped in at the deep end by accepting a task, which is this play. in fact i was going to refuse but i had to accept, 'they' made m e. the m ain theme they gave to me was very common, but safe and i was given enough time to write. for like a week i didn't even start, i didn't think about it and then i remembered and i said okay, you know what, fuck this. they want me to do what everyone else does. i'll give them and the audience the theme they want, but i'll do it my way. and i started to write nonstop, contextualizing the subject in a way no one ever dared before. i didn't care, i was just writing and soon i realized it's finished in just eight hours. because of this success i was feeling confident, i sent them the script saying listen to me, i am your only chance to put this play on the stage in time, here is my script, i know it's crazy but i also know it's good, accept it or accept it, i won't be directing anything other than this. politely. and they LOVED it, i must admit that i was surprised. the play will be staged three months later (which is also a short time like eight hours for a play but i'll handle it) and i might do voice acting. i'm sure they will cut out the best scenes 'because it's not appropriate' but doesn't matter. the important thing is i have the original script i have written and one day i will be able to revive it the way i want. after the play is performed i'll continue with small but fast steps because i still don't feel ready to run, just like i said before it's just the beginning. so here comes the questi on, is m y situation somehow similar to how you started doing your contents?","no, i was never able to make connections with other people, and in turn i learned never to have to rely on others to complete my work."

"I keep on writing songs that I like, but the stuff I end up writing typically doesn't work for the instrumentation I have access to at the moment. Any tips on forcing yourself to write for a specific intended purpose?","you don't have to do that, but you might want to try. you can do it either way. you can make what you wrote fit the instruments even when it seemed like it was written for other instruments, or you could also write to fit certain instruments. it's important to try both ways. to write to fit the instruments, make sure you have access to the instruments while you are writing. if you want to make what you already wrote without the instrument fit the instrument, well, you are going to have to be a little bit creative but it is always possible. if it doesn't work just keep trying. any song can be done anywhere, that's the golden rule."
"re: http://www.billwurtz.com/questions/q.php?date=201709142348 and http://www.billwurtz.com/questions/q.php?date=201709142226don't you think that progression in this case could be a helpful modifier to determine the difference between sets of chords that include the same functions but in a different order, in other words, the order of 6m-4-1-5 vs 1-6m-4-5 like in the second question? if progression is meaningless, it seems like heart and soul could sound like the same song as derulo fight for you or africa, but that's clearly not the case, because derulo fight for you sounds like africa but not like heart and soul. or there some other way you distinguish between the same chords occurring in a different order?","when you say chords to a song that implies that you are gonna say them in the right order. unless you are trying to confuse someone. it's like words to a song means the words to the song, in the right order. you don't have to say 'word progression' or whatever. you can just say 'the words', and hopefully the person will say them in the right order unless they are some kinda maniac."
do you think you'll ever change the font size font color or font font?,of what.
"bill, if i make a wish that you teach me sick chords would it happen today or tomorrow?","it depends on the song. you have to give me an example of a part of a song and ask me how you think the chords could be made sicker, for that song."

"Sorry if I'm oversimplifying this (I know you do all types of content... scrambles, the question page, reality, jazz, improv, notebook, etc)... But it seems like you kind of made a name for yourself doing all the vines and short videos. Then you didn't want to get pigeon-holed as The Guy Who Makes Short Videos and when your fans came to expect more and more short videos, you put out HOJ and HOTEWIG. Then when everybody started demanding more and more history videos, you didn't want to get labeled as The Guy Who Makes History Videos. Now, it seems like your focus is music videos for medium-length songs? My question is, what happens when everyone starts demanding more music videos and you become associated with this particular form of content? Will we see another big shift? Again, sorry if I'm oversimplifying your 'creative trajectory'. Like I said, I know you do all types of stuff. I'm a big fan of everything you put out, and you've been a huge inspirat ion to me as a musician myself, and as just a fellow person tryna be a person.Thank you for everything you do.","i think you understand the general path very well. except, there are many elements of my past work that are unilaterally right for me, and i will continue to use. so it is not necessarily a game of always doing something completely new. it is mainly just about filling out the space of all the potential things that i think would be good for me. if you look at the discussions i was having a few years ago, there were several major 'houses' of types of content that needed to be explored, none of which had been fully explored at the time. so that's why shifts were necessary -- to make sure i explored everything that needed to be explored. medium-full length songs, with videos, is extremely important and has been important for a long time, and i've always written a huge surplus of them, so there is a lot of catching up to do. but still, free-videos (videos that are not exclusively based on 1 song) both fictional and non, is still a hugely vast area to explore, and having done such a huge amount of work on extremely short projects (due to the 4-vid-per-week schedule, and later due to the success of my vine channel) there is still a huge amount of exploring to do in the longer ranges."
"today i wrote a scenario which is one hour long in EIGHT FUCKING HOURS with EVERY DAMN DETAIL to put on the stage, like everything including songs, dances, decor, costumes, etc etc. this was probably the fastest (and deepest) writing of mine and it's long, it's good, it's strong and i want to cry with happiness. it seems your small steps advice is working and this is only the beginning. i don't feel like i'm drowning in infinity anymore, it's raining and i'm catching the drops. thank you bill. so, what's the next advice of yours for me?","that actually seems like a huge step and not a small step, but it sounds like you are doing great, so congratulations. i have no idea how you managed to do it. for me to have advice for you you will need to first have another problem."
"Hey Bill, why not get a pair of monitor headphones to eliminate, or at least reduce the need of car-testing?","always need to car test. always need to test the mix in as many different locations as possible, and the car is a particularly unique location and it really allows the song to be heard from the listener's perspective, especially because you can't make any changes while in the car. my car system is actually not too good and it's a bit strange and probably has too much bass, but it doesn't matter. it's still important to test it there."

When you were at the 8th annual shorty awards and that nico guy performed what was going through your head?,"well, here's the thing- they did their hit song am i wrong which i think is a wonderful song, and i've had a strong attachment to that song ever since i first heard it on the radio. but here's the problem (there's actually 2 problems) the first problem was their live performance had no live elements at all. it was the studio recording with the lead vocal muted. there was absolutely no live feel to it, and the studio vocals were a bit better, because it had better editing. so we were basically hearing the exact original recording, except with slightly worse vocals. the other problem was, unfortunately, the song did not go over well with the audience. they did their best to energize the crowd by shouting things like shorty awards and put your hands up etc etc, but it just wasn't working. again, i absolutely love the song and i love the recording, so this is not a complaint about the artist or the song, this is just my analysis of the situation."
"How come when you have 4 eighth notes in a row, sometimes there all 4 grouped together and sometimes it's written as 2 groups of 2? Is there a difference?","the rule i follow is, never beam more than 4 in a row, and don't beam across the 'imaginary barline' halfway through the bar. so if it's 1 & 2 & beam all 4. if it's 3 & 4 & beam all 4. if it's 2 & 3 & beam it as 2 groups of 2 and leave the middle open. when it's the full bar, beam 2 groups of 4. for 16th notes you can apply similar rules except the 'imaginary bar line' would be between each beat, so again groups of 4 maximum, but don't beam anything across the imaginary barlines."

"hey, so i just heard this song on the radio, i thought it was a cover of toto's africa- it was a pretty shitty cover, but i thought someone was doing a cover of it. then when i looked it up later i found out that it was a jason derulo track called fight for you and it doesn't mention toto or africa anywhere on it. yet it has the same chords and even the same lyrics! it occasionally cut in some terrible pop verses but man it is actually a rip off and i wanted your thoughts on this?","it is a derivative of Africa. it is authorized, and the songwriters of Africa are properly credited and paid. popular songs very often are either covers, samples, or derivatives of previous popular songs, and most of the time the original writers are credited and paid. one of the most famous examples is surfin USA by the beach boys, which has the entire same melody as sweet 16 by chuck berry, who is credited and paid for surfin USA also. another famous example is Gansta's Paradise, which originally a Stevie Wonder song, who is credited and paid for Gangsta's Paradise as well. Another more recent example is Sam Smith's stay with me which was found to have nearly the same melody as won't back down by Tom Petty, and after an out-of-court settlement, tom petty is now credited and paid. there are hundreds more examples, and this has been common in popular music for many generations."

"Hi Bill! I was hoping you could maybe give me some tips on this. So, I play in a band with 2 guitarists (me being one of them). And for certain little sections in certain songs, I want to figure out a way to intertwine the rhythms of the 2 guitars in a way where it sounds like just 1 guitar, but with like a delay/echo type thing. Do you think if I play the same part the other guitarists plays, but slide the whole phrase forward like a 16th note (or maybe an 8th note?) that would kind of give it that delay/echo type sound? I don't have any recording equipment at home to experiment with.. but do you think this technique would work? Any tips or advice on how to make it sound extra crisp and natural?","if you are talking about live playing, i don't think this is a reasonable strategy. it sounds more like a fun/impressive stunt that would require a lot of practice to do it right AMAZING, watch 2 guitar players emulate a delay pedal, just by playing at slightly different times! not worth it. a fun stunt maybe, but not a good strategy. if you're talking about recording it, sure you could shift one track a little later and make it a little quieter with a little more reverb, but it would still be much easier to use a delay effect. very easy to get access to one. perhaps even easier than getting access to recording equipment, which is also easy."

If I'm at a concert and the band is playing a funky groove where they're accenting the first and third beats of the bar... am I supposed to clap on 1 and 3? Or do I still clap on 2 and 4?,1 and 3 and try to get the rest of the audience to switch to that too.

"so i began composing. I have a super great accompaniement that i'm really happy with, but i can't find for the life of me a good lead line. any tips?","i think most of the time it seems to be better to do it the other way around, but not always. if you have a good groove/accompaniment that seems good on its own, i would suggest taking hints from what's going on there, and just taking the melody straight from something that's already happening. in other words, if it already sounds so good, then that means it probably is almost enough as it is, with not too much room for anything else unrelated. so perhaps try to find the most stand-out distinctive part about it, and emphasize it more. or, another option, if there happens to be an obvious space or gap anywhere, work with that space. it seems like if what you have already seems good, as you said, then you should be very gentle when 'adding' anything."

But now when people say literally ('Man, I've literally been listening to this album non-stop all week') I don't know if that's what they actually mean.","words change. that's what they do. you wouldn't believe what some of the words we use commonly today were 'originally' 'supposed' to mean. in fact, i think the word 'literally' has certainly been through many transformations before this one. so your undertanding of it to mean 'exactly' is surely just one stop along a multi-century train ride of language transformation."

"hey bill can you give me some advice? i have aspergers, and i have been discriminated A LOT for it, which totally wrecked my self esteem. trough out middle and high school i've been treated like i'm a fucking retard. so much that even I believed i was a retard. i refused to shut up about having aspergers / being autistic tho, because i want people to know who i am. when i was 21 i decided to turn things around and stop telling anyone i was autistic, and tell the people who knew / still tought i was, i told them that the diagnosis was not right. not because it wasnt right, i dont know it if it was right. but that diagnosis made people not treat me right, and refuse to listen to who i actually am because the assumed they already knew, because they had read an article about aspergers or something. so right now in my life hardly anyone knows i used to wear this label. it feels good because for once people will actually listen to who i am instead of assum e. BUT t he misconceptions about aspergers remain. even with new people in my life, some of these people still think autistic = retarded / incapable of anything except math. i feel bad because by shutting up about my diagnosis i am not helping other who still get discriminated. should i 'come out' again as having aspergers? so that people will know people with aspgergers actually all have a different personality that is build up of many layers just like everybody else?","i say flip it, instead of letting someone else (mr. asperger) name your personality after them, why don't you try naming other peoples' personalities after you."

But the way it's voiced, I think is something like ACEG(raw), ACDF#(flame), GBDF#(live),to GBCE(wire).

"You got those 4 chords played in succession, but with very little movement between the voicings.","that's normal, that's how it's supposed to be done."

9.6.177:24 pm are you sure that donald trump wants to be president?,"being the president of the united states is something that you never quite know if you are ready for. i think many presidents realize when they get there that it is much more insane than they previously realized. so i can't confirm if donald trump has yet to have any of those realizations. but i know that one of the things that drives donald trump is to succeed as wildly as possible, and be incredibly famous and do things in a very large and big way, and be in the spotlight all the time. so being elected president was certainly in line with those goals. i am not sure what his goals are now that he has acheived that."

Also, just gotta say that looks like a 12-figure income town, but I love the shade of those license plates yeaaa... those lyrics and that melody gives me goosebumps whenever I listen to it. So good.","i think the original chart, as written in 2009, is posted on the expert page of this site. the song is mostly there, but some small revisions occured in 2012/13. the license plate line was a revision. i think the original line was not much for words and i'm not much for rhymes, but that don't mean i can't buy a coffee and i think there was a revision on that that went looks like a ?(some number) figure income town, but that don't mean i can't look around. and then the final revision, sometime in 2012 or 2013 was the license plate line. i was so happy with this line that this used to haunt me throughout 2013/14, whenever i would see a connecticut license plate i would be reminded of that line, and get burningly sad that that song hadn't been recorded yet, and no one had heard it. thankfully now it has, but there are many other songs of course, unrecorded, that still give me the same feeling."

how's the ground?,"very nice, and reliable."
"Say you you have a song in the key of C. Your melody note is C.... what would be the ugliest, worst chord you can play?","it depends what instrument(s) you have , how many players you have, and/or if you are allowed to overdub."

Can you tell us some fake news?,"yes, our top story is that you hate the letter Z, because you did not use it in your question. how mortified are you, and what kind of effect do you think this will have on your community going forward, and is this part of a larger conversation we need to be having."

Are there any songs out there you aren't able to understand musically/harmonically?,"in my view, music is meant to be heard and listened to, by humans (people). so being a human with a sense of hearing is all that is ever necessary to fully understand anything musically or harmonically. although sometimes music is paired with visuals for the full effect, and in that case it may require eyesight to get the full picture."

do i have to know advanced calculus and physics in order to understand the universe?,no.
"Hi! I know for some of your shorter songs/videos there are pieces that kind of go together (longer videos/stronger videos, cool sports/cruel sports, etc)... But I downloaded your 'medium length' songs and was playing them on shuffle on my computer... And I could swear some of them worked perfectly being played back to back. Is this just my imagination? Or did you write any of your 'medium length' songsto purposefully go with other songs in a particular order?","if there's any order to the songs, it would be the order they were written. which unfortunately is not preserved whatsoever in the recording, mainly because i can't record songs nearly as fast as i can write them, so i've always been hopelessly behind on recording, so i have to pick and choose. for example, 'new canaan' is really part of a series of 4 songs (well actually 5) but new canaan is the only one of those that has been recorded so far. 'future song' was written immediately after 'the song song' and i consider them sister tunes, but they were recorded 5 years apart."
Is North Korea in the north?,yes.
Does B.C. stand for Before Cheese? Or did they have cheese before year 0?,"in that calendar, there is no year zero. but the C actually stands for christ because that calendar is of christian origin. although the calendar was not created until a few hundred years after the story of christ takes place. i don't know if there was cheese before then."

"So, how much good has the fake release date of the 5th of September done to you?","it was very helpful in really pushing to new levels of speed and simplicity when doing the video. for the last several days i've been working on the music, and i was stuck momentarily on the usual demons and crises relating to that. but i had a big break through on a new way to do instrument randomization-- i've done instrument randomization before but there are always flaws in the system, where-as now i found a system that is really working extremely smoothly and easily, and i think it's very important to see it through. i still firmly believe i can get the song/video schedule down to 2 weeks for subsequent songs, and i am very excited for that."
am i crazy or did you recently change the look of the videos page?,i did not change it.
What was your first YouTube video?,"i don't really make videos specifically for youtube, i just make videos. but youtube is a ubiquitous and popular platform so i post them there as well."

"Usually when I play music, I feel lost and clunky and like I have no idea what I'm doing and I usually dislike what I play. But, if I bring my instruments into bed with me and play random whatever-comes-into-my-head while falling asleep, it sounds good. What's more surprising, if I record that and listen back later, I still think it sounds good. I'm trying to figure out why, and how to learn from my tired tunes to translate my sleepy success into awake awesomeness. I was hoping you may be able to advise me on how to bridge this gap.","sounds like you need a sense of direction. when you're going to sleep, you know what the agenda is. try playing music while you're on an important voyage."
"i get the sense that youre probably against personality tests, astrology, and other THIS IS WHO I AM tests which some people use to segment their personality into tiny boxes instead of Being The Human They Are. but have you ever looked into this stuff just for kicks? it can be silly and fun if you dont take it seriously?",i take personality very seriously.

"You answered a question recently saying that there's a circles of thirds(if I'm wrong I'm sorry) anyway, are there circles for every distance interval thing? Like is there a circle of 6ths? Circle of 4ths? 2nds? 7ths? That'd be cool if that's true.","sure, you could think of it that way. any interval when stacked will eventually get back to the same note. 4ths are just reversed 5ths, so the circle of 4ths is really the same as the circle of 5ths. 6ths and 3rds are the reverse of each other if you flip the major/minor, so everything i said about major/minor thirds would basically be true for 6ths as well if you switch the major and minor. it's just the notes will be further apart because they will be in the next octave. major seconds get back to the same note after 6 notes, it's called the whole tone scale, and it is a cliche device for a 'flashback' sort of sound. minor 2nds is just the chromatic scale, and you get back to the same note after 12. 7ths are the inverse of 2nds, again with the major/minor reversed, just like 6ths vs 3rds."
"sometimes i think my art thing is not finished, so i try to add more things to make it complete but then it gets to a point where the things i add are detracting from the overall effect. it is hard if not impossible to take things away once they are there. do you ever deal with this,?",yes.

"You often use jazzy electric organ glissandi in your music. Do you have a preference for a particular electric organ sound, be it Hammond, Farfisa, Vox, or even one of those crazy Roland organs with a theatre organ simulation?",i just use whatever is available. it is much easier to find a way to make music with what you have than to search the world for a certain thing that you think you want.

I am a native New Yorker yet I do not knownhow to pronounce Kozciuszko street. Can you please help. I just pronounce it as 'ko-dnxssddndns-$:!!' or 'kolonoscopy'?,"i asked a real polish person, and she told me kosh-Choosh-co which is actually exactly the way the recorded announcement on the J train was pronouncing it at the time. i've heard that the australians have a mountain of the same name, and they pronounce it much differently. but when pronouncing the brooklyn street, i defer to the train announcement, and the authentic polish pronounciation, which are both in agreement."

is it the question mark or the fact that something is being asked make a normal sentence into a question?,"in many languages and dialects (including the one you used in your question) 2 of the core words sometimes switch places when it's a question. but also an important factor is the plausibility that the thing is actually in question. additionally, if there is no question mark nor word reversal, often the presence of the word 'really/seriously/actually' can imply the question, if it is in conjunction with something that would plausibly be a question, in the context."
"Hello, I am interested in learning music. I know the notes and octaves and staffs and voice ranges. But I don't know what exactly a chord is. And how are they played? When do you use them? And what is the difference between flats and sharps? When are they used? If you can, please tell me. Thank you so much!","a chord is multiple notes at the same time. listen to any recorded song, and there is probably a 99% chance it has chords in it, unless it is just a singer with no accompaniment. how exactly to use them, well, i don't think there is any accurate way to explain it, but you can learn everything you ever need to know from experimentation. i'll give you a hint to get started, playing notes C, E, and G at the same time is called a C major chord, or often just called C. that should be more than enough to get started."
Why is the side of the coin without the head on it called tails?,"because sometimes there are tails on it, and the word 'tail' can also represent the other side of the body from the head, depending on what animal you're talking about, and depending on your willingness to say 'butt'."
"Do you ever feel like despite trying to expand your horizons, your fans will, no matter what, rope you back into history videos?","fans have never roped me into anything. in fact, they usually push me away from stuff. for example, history of japan was made during the time when the fans were only trying to 'rope' me into doing vines for the rest of my life, or 'shaving my piano, part 2'."
"when people ask what's the password for the reality page, you always say that there's no password, but if there is no password, then why did you take the fucking time to create a box to put passwords? is the password hide or something? don't make my thing green. do people have to make an anagram for there's no password sentence? and that would be the answer? please bill, please. i feel so left out when other fans know something that i don't know! :( like an idiot.",

"This would ordinarily not matter, but many look up to you and you often share thoughts and advice with them. You may be misleading some people.

what does the im feeling randy button do?,"it randomizes the questions, and displays them one at a time."
"Hi Bill! I'm learning piano, and I really love that funky synth sound. But sometimes I have hard time figuring out certain chords I hear (maybe cause the notes of a chord played on a synth blend together more than a piano chord?)... But I was wondering if you can help me out with this. In this song, could you tell me the voicing for the chord that plays around the 1:44 right after 'just can't wait no more'?","that's a closed Bmin7 voicing, but it might likely have been played as Amin7 and bent up, depending on whether the player prefers to pull down the bender first and bend up to the chord, or play the chord first lower and then raise the bender. so you could play G,A,C,E, and bend it up, or pull back the bender first and play A,B,D,F# and then bend it back to center. also important to mention that this tape is also running just a hair sharp."
Also those little chord hits that play around 2:44 right after 'baby I'm sure you would'? Here's the song. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVSfnXeYmtQ?,"Amin6. very densely, possibly doubled in octaves, because there is definitely high A (880), but the F#(the 6 note) seems to be coming from more than an octave below. and in between you surely would have your C and E. it's just really dense and thick. also drenched in vibrato. it's Amin6, which means it includes notes A, C, E, F#. intuition tells me that this sound is automatically doubled an octave, and it's a one handed 5-note voicing with A on both ends. left hand would be working the bender/vibrato wheels."
What's the scariest fact you know?,halloween is coming up.
"I want to make more content, but I don't have the money to buy the things that will allow me to do so, and working jobs I don't like just for money makes me want to be not alive.

can you paint a house with a toothbrush?,sure.
"Can I use a tritone substitution irl? Like if I feel sad, can I substitute my sadness with a tritone?","tritone substitution does not mean substituting something for a tritone. it means you keep the tritone the same, and switch the rest."
"when you reply some of these questions with your songs, are they already written at the moment or do you come up with them after reading the question?","doing recording projects just for the questions page would be extremely irresponsible. it takes long hours and work to record songs. that is one of the reasons i am always able to keep this page (and twitter) updated so frequently, because it's just text."
What should I tell people who shame me for not knowing what they know and doing what they do?,have you tried shaming them.
"Will you ever make a feature film? If everyone who saw HOTEWIG went, you'd have so much power?",hotewig took 11 months of solid work. doing anything larger without a full cast and crew would be irresponsible for a human of non-infinite life span.

"I've been fired twice for taking jobs that were way beyond my capabilities thinking that it was better to get fired for trying than missing out on an opportunity to learn from and be around people I admired. Ever since these 'failures', I started seeing a pattern and now I've decided to stop working altogether so I won't feed the pattern again (also because it hurts to be rejected). Bill, what should I do? I feel so desperate that I'm on the verge of taking any job just so I stop feeling guilt?","apply to 100 more jobs, of all different types."
how can i prevent myself from being 'that weird kid in the class'?,become an adult.
if you were a inventor of rubik's cube how would you name it?,"this drastically goes against my distaste for naming things after myself, but in that particular case i think i would indeed call it the wurtz cube. that being said i did not invent the rubik's cube and i am not an expert on the rubik's cube so please do not call it the wurtz cube."
