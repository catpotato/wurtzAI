'not so hard to do' was just bringing the collection down. i just didn't like it. i think i would have been more comfortable putting it there if there had been more other videos there. and  i took down the 'foot' video because the suggested video images that popped up on screen afterwords were horrifying. they were all like insane foot diseases etc. it was very overwhelming, and they came up instantly after my video. it was just too much. i normally don't pay attention to that sort of thing, but this was right when i was first using youtube and i was pretty uncomfortable with that, especially because i was used to putting the videos on my own site, where they can live in peace."

Anything. there's just 10 times more stuff to do than i could ever do at a reasonable pace. it is very difficult because normally i can only think clearly when i do everything myself, but i think it's a good idea to at least try to open those doors. the bad part is now i'm gonna get a thousand emails and i won't be able to respond to them all end everyone's probably gonna get mad at me for that. keep in mind i've never worked with anyone and i don't really know how to do it. but i'm trying to at least open up the possibility in case it magically works somehow."

How can fans help with merch?,"i'm losing my mind over merch. i hated it, i never wanted to do it. i don't want to do it. so forgive me if i am every which way on finding a strategy. the only reason i am considering it is because i found a company that wants to do merch with me and they have the capability of doing take-downs on illegal merch. like when someone else sells billwurtz shirts and makes money off it, the company i'm working with can take those down. i wish i could just do take downs, and not make any merch. i really don't like merch, it makes me sad for some reason. but people told me they are being targetted with ads from redbubble selling my merch, so in other words people are making billwurtz stuff and making money off it, AND they are targetting my fans to buy it. like i said, i wish i could just do take downs, but no one is ever gonna agree to help me do take downs if we can't sell our own stuff instead. right now i'm designing it myself, but it is time taken away from doing videos etc. it's the worst. and any moment i could snap out of it and change my mind and go back to 'no merch.' i made a steve shirt, and i know people are asking for those, but that just seems gross for me, especially in a few weeks, to see a steve shirt, especially if i don't get a chance to make a broad library of merch, just to have that one shirt? terrible. i can't stand it. so it's very weird and i don't want to be spending time on this. but i'm scared to let other people design stuff because then i'm going to have a million people sending me things and let's say one of their ideas is very simple, or what if 2 people have the same idea, and then it gets used, people are going to be upset that they think i'm stealing their ideas. so i really don't know what to do, although right now i am using a randomize strategy where i pick a random video and make something out of it, but if you have any specific requests i would love to hear them. maybe there is a certain thing you would want that i might not have thought of. this is a very confusing issue and i'm sorry."

can you write the worst poem ever created?,"it is impossible for any poem to hold that distinction because anything that makes it the worst is also going to be the reason it's meaningful, and great. the worst poem status will always be held by a quantity of poems approaching infinity, like an exponential function graph. the situation is further conplicated by the fact that there is no actual way to measure how good a poem is, or even to determine whether or not something is a poem."

Did you consider releasing the Steve video in three separate parts as a series? It seems like it could stand almost as a combination of two old-style vine stuff clips and a mountain conclusion?,"posting things with vine-like time constraints, on a platform which allows longer time lengths, often produces catastrophic results. not to mention, the amount of less than 10 second material in my catalog is alarmingly too high (because of the vine content, and other reasons as well) so i am very keen to keep things at least above 30 seconds for now."

"Analysis:Part 1: play by playThe video opens up with our protagonist Steve introducing himself. The very next thing he tells us is that he drives a car thats stuck in a tree. He then goes on to admit he was lying and that his real name isn't steve. he then says that he's filing for an extension on his taxes because he didn't pay them but in the same sentence says doesn't plan to do them. Why? Because thats the way he likes to live his life and he feels like everything's gonna be fine. The day ends. The next day he tells the viewer that hes skipping work again, implying he does it frequently, but clarifies that its because hes unemployed. The mailman delivers mail but he adds the details that he was late and wa s actual ly a woman. She then breaks into the same jingle steve did earlier saying thats the way i like to live my life... . All of a sudden theres a change of scenery and he starts talking about mountains that we can see are right behind his house yet he says I don't remember why i first saw the mountains. He then says that they've ALWAYS been there. He wonders why they're there but whether he knows or not he has to accept that they're there. He says that he can't claim them. Then he does a complete 180 and states that he can and does so very quickly. He then starts the jingle from before. Thats the way i like to live my life.. but he gets cut off right as he starts, its another mail delivery. This time the person delivering it is a bird but he doesn't mention anything about it nor does he mention anything about the mail being delivered straight to him rather then to his house. The mailman doesn't break into a jingle this time, only saying heres the mail. The letter is adres sed to s teve despite that not being his name, which he points out, and it asks how he climbed the mountain. Steve says he glad the person asked and gives a simple answer saying that its a simple two step process, first find the mountain, then climb it. After this steve breaks into the last jingle of the video but this time he says Thats the way we can get things done and thats how I do it, its easy and simple cause you know what to do. Steve stands there smiling when a downpour starts but steve doesn't react at all simply standing there and smiling. A 5 day weather forecast pops up on screen showing nothing but rain for each day and it moves rapidly showing rain for many more days then 5. Steve then says bye i'm steve despite saying it wasn't his name earlier and the screen cuts to black.Part 2: Breakdown of SteveThis is obviously a very confusing story. The main character steve makes many contradictory and strange statements and bizarre things ha ppen wit h no explanation. To fully understand this we need to look at the story part by part then look at the big picture. First of all why does steve introduce himself as steve and then say thats not actually his name? The character steve seems to represent many things throughout the story, at times he operates the same as any normal person, or character in a story might but at other times he does very strange things. He changes his identity and says things that are impossible such as him driving a car in a tree, theres also a point where a talking bird delivers him mail. Steve doesn't pay taxes and doesn't have a job, He's also secluded from others in the mountains. These traits are indicative of multiple personality disorder and schizophrenia. The viewer isn't a character in the story but he talks to the viewer, rather then just narrating whats happening I think steve is talking to himself and the viewer is seeing whats happening through his eyes, this is why we saw the bird talk ing. The  first real thing does in the story is file for an extension on his tax returns and then say he wont ever be paying them. Although this statement may seem like he doesn't plan to pay what he owes, I think whats actually happening is steve doesn't owe anything at all. Steve doesn't appear to live in a city but rather a rural area with mountains so it may be either he is excused from paying taxes because of his mental ailments or the government of his country doesn't require its citizens to pay taxes.Part 3: breakdown of eventsFirst, Either way the point of him filing for an extension is pointless,?","filing for an extension on my taxes i thought was a nice line for that point in the video because it was a nice contrast to the much simpler items that come before it (drive a car, in a tree, what's your name, that type of stuff.) it was fun to jump to something much more 'grownup' and verbose. but the line also has a twist at the end because he says he's never going to pay the taxes. which i thought was a fun idea because if he's not going to pay them, then why is he filing for an extention, right."
He's secluded in the mountains?,that's not necessarily true yet at this point in the video.
One day the mailman delivers the mail?,.
"Steve might have just imagined the mailman doing the jingle as well. I think the two most important things here are that first of all the mailman was late, in the way that steve is late to life. As a fully grown adu lt?",that is not necessarily true.
"He doesn't know why he first saw them,?",.
"he wasn't aware that he was being medicated but they've always been there, just like his mental issues. He feels like he'll never be able to climb them but after the delivery?",.
"The medication didn't solve the underlying problems but merely allowed him to hide them,?",.
"he does a jingle but its different this time,?",.
theres no mention of him being alright or happy?,"i think the music sounds very, very happy. he's also smiling and dancing. and the lyrics to the jingle are very happy. this part of the video screams happiness with flying colors, but i respect your opinion."
"Everntually steve accepts that this wont change. He says Bye i'm steve showing that he's lost who he truly is,?",.
This is a dark commentary on how the mentally ill live in todays society and the overmedication not being an answer. Steve was fine before anyone decided his pointless life wasn't ok and after they decided they fixed him steve lost the person he was when he was happy and can no longer bear his own life.﻿?,
"How long did it take to create your new video? (hi, i'm steve)?",
Sometimes grey things are a little less (or more) grey than you think?,"ah, yes."
"When will you release a full jingle/instrumental from your newest video hi, i'm steve?","the steve video is complete, as is."

what is your opinion on cacti?,"needless to say, my opinions on cacti are too controversial to be stated here."
why is everything confusing?,to keep it interesting.

have you ever considered modding people on your channel to fight the rising number of people impersonating you on your comments?,yes.
Knock knock?,come in.
People got mad that you didnt include canada in history of the entire world i guess... what are your thoughts?,"it's impossible to mention everything there ever was, in a 19 minute video. leaving out canada was actually a deliberate misdirect to distract from all the 1000s of other things i had to skip, just to make the entire history of the universe from big bang to present actually fit in less than 20 minutes and more importantly be produceable in less than a year."
so let's say we're playing a tune and a c7b9 chord comes along.what scale do you sing over it?,i'd prefer to sing something more musical than a scale. but it depends how the song goes.
Whats the most normal thing you've done in your life?,try to figure out what the heck is going on.
what are your thoughts on musicals?,you might find a song or two.
will you cover blue rondo a la turk by that dave guy?,i would consider it.
"Hi Bill .?. Hope you're doing great. I'm wondering if you use isochronic tones or binaural beats in your music. It's pretty dope how your music makes me feel like you're massaging my brain. Thanks so much for sharing your music with us. Try not to worry about how fast or in which order you will get it all done in. What matters is that you're actually doing it.And also, I love you?",i have never heard the word 'isochronic' or 'binaural' before. i'm not sure if that answers your question.
"What is the actual name of the guy in your latest video? He insisted his name was not Steve, but at the end of the video he said his name was Steve. I'm very confused. Plz halp thx?",i'm not sure i have never met him.
how much questions do you ignore?,2.
"wait, didn't you say that your next video would be much longer than a minute,?",no.
"or did i misread, and you meant the next *long* video, and this is to keep us entertained?",i don't know what you're talking about.
a picture says a thousand words but so does a dictionary. why do pictures get all the credit?,"dictionaries already get a lot of credit. perhaps too much. some people think the dictionaries are inventing the words. they are not. they are just trying to keep up. or at least some of them are, while other ones prefer to stay the same as long as possible."
"i know you like answering music/music theory related questions,?","that's not true, i find it very stressful to keep finding ways to explain to everybody how to use their ears and spirits."
"is there any philosophy yo personally agree with? (ie. nihilism, absurdism, existentialism, etc)?",i think it's more fun when you melt them and mix them together.
whats your favorite video?,roundhay garden scene.
how can i teach myself bass guitar and/or how did u learn?,"i nice strategy is to plug in (to a practice amp or any amp, just make sure it's something so you can hear it) and practice along to your favorite recordings, and kill the low frequency on the recordings. this can usually be done in your music player's equalizer, or, even easier, just listen to the music on laptop speakers or phone or tablet speakers without plugging in headphones. you can't hear the bass on those devices. and play along."
what's your favorite thing to do on this besides answering questions?,making sure i didn't screw up the answers.
what is ur favorite candle scent?,hot flame.
did you procure a graphics tablet of some sort so that you could have your handwriting in the new video?,"i bought it last september, to use on history of the world."
what's steve's real name?,i'm beggining to think it might be steve.
why was I born in the wrong body?,for an extra challenge.
what is a thing that is only good in excess and not in moderation?,.
is rationality rational?,it better be.
what are your intentions?,
Do you resent other artists for monetising their content? Or is it more just a personal thing?,"it doesn't bother me unless i am trying to watch one of their videos in which case i changed my mind i don't have time to wait for the darn video, oh well i guess they don't really want me to see the video. i wonder what the video was about."
When you reply to questions with original videos did you make that video right then just as the answer or was it somehting you just had from ages ago that you link?,i never make videos for questions. that would be insane. i'm already trying to make videos and content for a million other places and it always seems like nothing is being updated except the thing i'm working on. one of the reasons this page is the most updated is because it extremely low budget production cost. i just type answers to questions. sonetimes even copy the old answers because all the questions have really been asked before.
How did this question page start out? Did you put it here when you first put up the website and then just let people start asking questions or was it more pre-meditated like people asked you to do it so you did?,"i wanted to make one but i didn't know how. so i did questions on ask.fm instead. this was good because the fans don't have to sign up, they are allowed to ask anonymously. this was going great until i found out that's not true. you do have to sign up. so i tried harder to learn how to make my own, and i made my own. and i liked it much better because i got to make it exactly how i want."
are you aware of the lick at 14:15 in history of the entire world?,"i want to answer, but that would require opening the video and risk seeing/hearing part of it. which is something i have not done since it came out, and will not do for a long time. i do sometimes use 'the lick' on purpose, and while i don't remember using it in that video, i also don't remember anything from the video."
how do i tap into the improvisational power of the lydian mode?,i don't think it has the kind of power you're looking for. i think the kind of power you're looking for is in all the notes.
how do i not get bored of playing guitar? sometimes i just sit there and i dont know what to do... i don't want to learn songs anymore and i want to do more improvising but it just seems... eh?,"join some bands that play popular music at bars, weddings, or other venues, on a regular basis. this should put everything into perspective."
do you like square waves or triangle waves better?,why can't  i integrate them both into my repertoire in a balanced way.
i dont speak english?,that's ok.
you seem like a guy who makes content 24/7/365?,perhaps the reason it seems that way is because i explain on here every day that that is what i do and i am also telling the truth when i explain it.
will you make a song with only the word fuck?,probably not.
How long until the new video comes out?,not long but i can't be sure.
do you know what's going on?,i have some ideas.
yo can you make your 404 page prettier please?,
i recently broke up with my girlfriend. how do i get her back?,i think you should focus on getting yourself back.
why do you never put ads on your videos?,"because they are a major drag on the viewing experience, and they shatter the intimacy of the relationship with the viewer."
are you aware you spelled stiqueons wrong?,"are you aware that when designing titles and logos, you can put the letters in creative orientations and directions."
do you like pictures?,oh hell yeah.
Do you ever get sick? what do you do then? (like do you still work or do you rest or something)?,"yes, i continue to work, and also rest as much as possible so as to get better and continue working as soon as possible. i actually was just sick yesterday and the day before but it wasn't that bad."
"the fonts look different today, what did you do?",nothing.
