"there was a question on this page a while ago about how everyone asks different variations of the same questions and how it shows that it's too hard to be original and how humans are all the same and boring, and naturally, it did not feel good reading that. but today i had the thought that maybe something being common doesn't necessarily mean it can't have value. do u think this is reasonable?",of course.

is there any way you can explain the key changes in this song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POfOycet4bE (except the obvious first one at 0:12)?,"in general, the verses are 3 keys 'sharper' than the chorus. the verses are in Eb (or Cmin) and the chorus is in Gb (Ebmin)."
it sounds like there is no key change from the chorus to the verse at 1:30-1:40 (same as 0:12-0:22)?,"going from the chorus to the verse, they use Eb as a pivot point, because Eb minor exists normally in Gb, and if you arrive at Ebminor but then use Eb major instead, then that sets you up to go forward in an Eb maj key (or Cmin)."
"but i know something weird must be going on here because of the super surprising key change at 2:23, putting it back in the same key it was at 0:12?","going from the verse to the chorus they do not use that pivot point, they jump from the G7 (which sounds like it is setting up for Cmin) and immediately go to Bma7 (as b6 of the new Ebmin key)."
"in the 'ngiueh' song video, you press some buttons on your keyboard, but it just looks like you are pressing them randomly, not actually setting anything up. is this true?","i don't remember but music videos are a performance for the video, not the actual recording of the song."

I find myself panicking and stressing myself out doing this though. So how to not panic? Or is panic is necessary to do better?    -Mr. Freak?","start practicing with a metronome. take it as slow as you need so you can actually sight read it. when you run out of tunes, get another book -- try to get one with actual tempo markings so that way you can keep track of what your handicap is, relative to the song's actual tempo, and that way you can very gradually increase the tempo. also a good technique is learning to look ahead. i know that seems crazy but that is really how you get it done."

"Hey Bill, I've been checking up on your questions page once a week for a couple months now. Right off the bat I was fascinated not only on how you function as an artist, but in your day-to-day life, your survival strategy if you will. And you even give a specific date on when you stared making videos non-stop save for a one-week break!As an artist myself, this is very inspiring as I feel I've been stuck with a bunch of material written but not recorded. Like... what does one need to do to work on the level your doing? How do I engage this? Is it a personal event, or a simple yet sudden change of mind that causes this paradigm shift (if that's the proper term)?","you are on the right track. there are a million ways to do things, and that might make your head spin for a while. but eventually when you can't take it anymore, you will start anywhere because it doesn't matter where. and you will learn everything along the way. i could give you more details on how the transition occured for me, but i've surely explained it 100 times on here already."

"I thought of a melody last night, but realized today it was essentially the start to a chorus of another song. I have some ideas on how to change it enough to not rip it off, is that good? And does that ever happen to you?","sure, it happens to everyone. if you've got a great simple melody, chances are many people have used it before. depending on how distinctive it is, it may be fair game, like there are certain 3-note patterns that are so common they are fair for anyone to use because they've already been used so many times. each case is different, just use your best judgement. either way, you probably won't have any problems unless you get a top 10 hit, and if you do get a top 10 hit, everyone will try to sue you regardless of whether you copied anyone."
You mentioned you make videos for capitalistic survival?,no i didn't.
"(revolutionizing education & art to gain an income to retain your current and desired comforts). In a socialistic utopia, where you get bought as a pet by robot overlods taking care of each and every need you may have, what do you see yourself doing?","the same things i'm doing, but way more of it."

"I have analyzed your song New Canaan and came to the conclusion that the song is about a guy who's going to prison and he's addressing to his daughter that he killed.My evidence is 1. you like singing about jail/prison 2. there is a federal prison in Pennsylvania called Canaan 3. the narrator is unreliable as he suffered a nervous breakdown as told by I'm going crazy. 4. He's riding on a train (on his way to prison) and he's hungry for food and women (he's not gonna see a woman again any time soon) 5. He talks about loving the shade of those license plates i.e. he's making license plates, a stereotypical prison job.My theory is that he loved his daughter and went crazy before killing her and his nervous breakdown only got worse as he got sentenced to life in prison so he wrote this song to say what he wants to tell his dead daughter whom he loved dearly. As he's talking to his daughter, he feels the need as a father to protect her from the truth, and lies about details by saying he's actually going to connecticutAt first he tries to convince himself that it's all for the better and that he's happy, evidenced by how he says he hopes the train doesn't get derailed, and how the season is winter, and the sky is so blue but gradually comes back to reality and understands the severity of the situation, as line it's summer and the sky has turned grey and my dreams are sailing away indicates he has spent enough time in prison for the seasons to change. On a scale of 100% to 100%, how close is my interpretation?",wildly incorrect.

i want to write a song with different time signatures in but whenever I try it just sounds like two different songs spliced together in a messy ungood way please help?,"different time signatures are kind of like a toaster repair kit. it is great and useful for fixing toasters! but if you don't have a broken toaster, you will have a very hard time figuring out what to do with a toaster repair kit."

"What other non-car tests do you do on your songs, if any?","a typical type of test to do is just make sure you are walking around the room while listening to it, on speakers. i find this to be good practice. a lot of people sit squarely at the desk, facing the speakers the entire time, and i just think you are missing out on how the song is really going to affect someone living in the real world. so it is good to hear it while walking around, in a wide range of locations throughout the room, not just 'ground zero.'."
I watched your 'harmonizing the weather lady' video. Did you notice a natural time signature in her voice that you used to write your music? Was there a natural pattern you could follow? I'm interested because I've always heard that people read and speak in beats/patterns and was wondering what you thought of this.,"that video didn't have notation, so there was really no need to decide."
"is it musically possible to modulate the vocals but not the backing track and have it sound ok, or will it always sound dissonant?","if you want to raise the vocals but not the rest of the music, you would have to do it note by note. each note would move a different amount. you could just do it harmonically using mostly maj/min thirds and also 4ths, or better yet re-imagine the line entirely. but i'm not sure i understand the situation you are doing this for."
What do you think about locks and privacy?,a symbolic relic from a time before we trusted ourselves.
are there any fun things you don't get to do any more because of the video?,"not because of this video specifically, but because i have been steadily working on videos and other projects non-stop since 2014. and yes there are things that i miss out on, but the objective is to integrate those elements into my work over time, so that i not only get to enjoy them but also share them. this strategy has worked many times so far and i expect it to work many more times in the future."
