?,"that was probably the most fun part. explaining the motivations for a universe happening, from the perspective of there not being a universe. and it's really common sense, i think, if you look at it from the right perspective, but the problem is you are not allowed to properly use time or space in the description because those things only exist if there is a universe. and most language as we know it is based on time and space. so it makes for some thrilling turns of phrase."

Will you do an anagram in the wrong section? (this one)?,"i used to do them here, before there was an anagrams page. i used to respond to any question asking about anagrams by anagramming the question instead of answering it. this unfortunately lead down a rabbit hole of people asking for longer and longer anagrams. this was thrilling for me, but the really long ones were actually taking me all day. and with the format of this page, i can't save them for later, because i always answer questions in chronological order. so basically it would stall the questions page (or else i would have to skip it, which i didn't want to do). this is really what made me realize i need to build the anagrams page, and take requests, and i can take them out of order and just work on them whenever i get a chance."

I was just wondering I you ever heard of this kind of thing. Take care. -bro-bro?,"but here's the ironic thing: there are many many people who frolic all over the place telling people they have perfect pitch, but whenever you test them, they're not even close. my point is, if you have the skill that you have (springboarding off a strong memory of C) then not only can you get the job done, but you can probably do it better than most people who actually claim to have it. so i say you might as well just say you have it. to increase your strength, familiarize yourself with where a low C is in your vocal register, (you can usually hum it quietly, should be a casual and easy note for a male, if you are a male) and just practice trying to find that note while other songs are playing. also familiarize yourself with the key of every song you've ever heard, and always learn what key songs are in. this will help you even more. perfect pitch (absolute pitch), or the sneaky workaround you have, is not at all required to be a wonderful and great musician, BUT it will provide you with an extra edge in professional situations."
Would you ever consider putting all your songs on Spotify into one playlist (such as Bill Wurtz's songs) so it would be easier to listen to them all at once? Spotify makes it really hard to flick between singles?,"oh, i thought it was pretty easy for users to make their own play list. but maybe i am wrong because i don't use spotify. if anyone is an expert on that stuff please email me about it."

if your songs page has all of these snippits of songs from your vine why isn't lets go to africa and find love in the jungle on it?,that's a good qustion. drawing the line for what gets included on the songs page is an ambiguous and imperfect endeavor. i have changed my mind several times and it will never be quite right. it's this kind of ambiguity that this entire site was built in the face of. the entire reason this site exists is because i was able to learn to live with that sort of ambiguity.
do you support Donald Trump?,"yes, i am giving him $5 daily allowance. i hope he is using it responsibly."

do u have piercings?,no.
do you ever have ideas that seem fine by themselves but not when you put them together and if so how do you deal with that?,"well in general i find that it's not a happy strategy to just be frankensteining ideas together. in fact that has never once worked for me. instead what really only seems to work is to custom make the second idea knowing that it's going to go with the first idea. so that means if you have an idea in your idea collection that feels like the second part of something, you're going to have to work backwards and come up with the first part knowing it's going to go to lead into the second part. i should add a disclaimer because sometimes i get hate mail on this subject -- just to clarify, there is surely nothing wrong with combining 2 separate ideas into 1, and it may work very well for other people but it has never worked for me."

why is elevator music so bland?,so as not to distract you from your elevator ride.
10.16.1711:09 pm  why not get the kind that has the long eraser that you can twist out as it wears down and replace when it runs out? even if you got a new one each time it would last a lot longer than one with a tiny unreplaceable nub. usually they come with extra erasers (and lead) in the pack. they cost more but it would probably end up the same or less as the amount of pencils you would go through in the same length of time. it likely makes little difference but maybe you might want to try and see if you like it?,"i like my current brand so much there is no way you are going to get me to change. i buy large packs and they are all different colors. however, i haven't used any pencils in a long time because where i am it is currently the year 2017."

"Question for Bill Wurtz on 10.1.17 4:23 pm : define random.Bill says chosen without reason blah blah preferably by computer to eliminate accidental reasoningI feel the particular response to be inadequate due to some researchOne thing that traditional computer systems aren't good at is coin flipping, says Steve Ward, Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. They're deterministic, which means that if you ask the same question you'll get the same answer every time. In fact, such machines are specifically and carefully programmed to eliminate randomness in results. They do this by following rules and relying on algorithms when they compute.You can program a machine to generate what can be called random numbers, but the machine is always at the mercy of its programming. On a completely det erminist ic machine you can't generate anything you could really call a random sequence of numbers, says Ward, because the machine is following the same algorithm to generate them. Typically, that means it starts with a common 'seed' number and then follows a pattern. The results may be sufficiently complex to make the pattern difficult to identify, but because it is ruled by a carefully defined and consistently repeated algorithm, the numbers it produces are not truly random. They are what we call 'pseudo-random' numbers, Ward says.- MIT School of EngineeringHow do you feel about this? Will you stay with your stance of preferring computers to eliminate accidental reasoning or have you been influenced to believe that the machine can never trump human creativity?","if you just take a number value associated with the current time, on a very small scale, and convert it to mod7 for example, (if you are looking for a number from 1 to 7) you will easily get random choices that no human user could ever manipulate. but furthermore, there are even some more advanced techniques happening on random.org which enables it to easily give me random sequences of numbers which are more than good enough for anything i could possibly need random numbers for."
