I just saw your video on Japan. You dont seem to have an email so I'll leave it here.  You mentioned that Japan conquered Korea. You should probably change it to tried to conquer Korea or get your facts straight.,"i can't change a youtube video. also, once a project is done i don't change it. it is more important to move forward to other projects."
"This is a very sensitive topic to this day in Korea. Our national heroes fought for freedom and it wasnt for ignorant meme making fools to make fun of. For you to make a video without stating the facts is blatant disrespect and disregard for the many Koreans that have fought for Korea's independance.  Many comfort women are still requesting for an apology from the Japanese prime minister, Abe, an asshole that calls them prostitutes. A country cannot be considered developed if it doesnt owe up to its mistakes. So, in conclusion, fix yours.","the video is supposed to be a fun and crazy time. i am sorry if you did not have a good time. hopefully you may like some of my other videos. if not then you don't have to watch them. there are some other channels that go into those issues in more depth. as you may see from my other videos, that is not really what my channel is all about.  please stay away from my videos if you don't enjoy them. it is also important to remember that in that particular video, i used a lot of metaphors (like 'ipads' in the year 1000!) so perhaps if i said 'conquer' maybe 'invade' would have been more accurate? again, razor-sharp fool-proof plain facts is not really what my videos are about. check out some of my other videos and i think you will see what i mean. maybe at some point i will make a video about korea that makes the japanese mad. it is not my goal to make anyone mad, i am just trying to make fun videos, but if millions of people see a video, chances are someone might be mad about something and i am sorry that had to be you. but please stay away from the channel if it is not right for you."
