"I guess Zappa is good. do you have more mainstream aspirations like releasing albums,?","i don't think songs need to be in groups. from what i can tell, it is usually the singles that are mainstream, not the albums."
Cause it seems you're pushing yourself to make all this crazy new content at a crazy rate and it's like you're putting yourself back in prison for no other reason than i wanna do this song or that video asap?,"most people still don't even think i am making any content. they always think i've 'stopped.' this is because it is impossible to make content instantly, especially if it is anything of a reasonable size. so therefore i need to hustle like crazy just to keep things coming out at a somewhat reasonable rate."
"did you know that if you change the dco style you don't have to use the h3 tags anymore? where you havedco {color:#E9EC54;}just change it todco {color:#E9EC54;display: block;font-size: 20px;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 0;margin-right: 0;font-weight: bold;}those values are the default browser values for h3, so you can just use dco and it won't mess up the previous questions either?","ah, that seems nice, but did you know if i leave it the way it is it still works fine and i don't even have to change anything."

isn't it crazy how the circle of fifths gets more insightful the more you learn about music?,i'm not sure. when i heard about it i already understood its importance.
http://www.billwurtz.com/reality/201305142137.mp4what happened to these? do you plan on posting any of the old improv videos?,"i was able to put up some of them, in may 2016, but it was right after spending 3 months doing all the reality videos. so it was like an emergency to get back to 'real content' so i cut the project short much sooner than i would like. so there is a sadly small amount of improvs that were posted. really looking forward to putting up much much more but i don't know how the hell that would ever factor in to the hopeless tornado of different things that need to be done."
if I made you a video for one of your new songs (and you enjoyed it) what would you do with it?,"i might be looking for people to make videos for my songs. it is important for the songs to have videos but i need to have time to make the songs, if that makes sense. but then again i'm not sure, because i've always done all my own content and i think it could get strange if i change that, but i am backed into a corner here, i don't know what else to do. looking for solutions that allow me to move at a reasonable pace."

It says on the songs page that the chips (sponsored) video is 0:05 but it's actually 0:10?,"it was designed as a looping video, of 5 seconds. there is only 5 seconds of content, but on the non-looping sites, it would be a little unfair to let it go around only once."
do you get mad at anyone ever?,only in dreams.
you spelled questions wrong?,that's a title design.
"have you ever pondered changing your website to a different font, potentially even a sans-serif like your videos? here are some ideas to make your brain juices start churning: http://imgur.com/a/yGTZh?",i prefer to keep the website fontless. that way it will be delivered in whatever font your device prefers.
What is the best way to compare apples to oranges?,start with the aspects that seem the most obvious to you.
why are most of your song titles Capitalized on spotify? (also how can anyone say you never use capital letters when the song titles are clearly capitalized on spotify)?,"because one of the companies i pay to upload my music does not allow the lowercase option, because they say that spotify does not allow that option. which is apparently not true because the other company i pay to upload is able to do lowercase."
please in your life time please make a cover of magic!'s rude?,"that idea has crossed my mind several times, and i usually decide to skip that one because the original version is too good."
do you have a video schedule?,"not right now, although i wish i did."
"in your eventual performances, will you be singing from your keyboard? i know the answer's probably yes bc it seems more efficient to me that way but you do come from a drumming background too after all?","i would prefer to have the instrumental arrangements able to be fully covered by the other players, to free me up for vocals only. it makes for a stronger sound. unless it is a solo song, in which case the same person playing and singing would be a better choice."
is anytime a good time to stop worrying what other people think?,oh hell yeah.
what's the deal with wrong spelling? is it just the aesthetic or MAYBE you're TRYING TO tell us something ImPoRtsbt?,"spelling can be used to communicate, or also have a little fun. i'm not sure if that answers your question."

"does this apply to how you view ur music?: People look for all sorts of hidden meanings. It's serious, but it's also not serious. It's true, but it's also a joke.- George Harrison?","to me, a joke would be like if i thought of a cool idea for a song but never did it. serious is when i take that cool idea and actually build something that actually exists, and can be seen/heard by others."
give me a good prank call please?,all calls are prank.
how's 2017 been for you so far?,"the first third was tough, i was trying to finish a huge video which i was working on for 11 months.  ever since then i've been doing songs but i would love to find a balance where i can do enough different kinds of things at a fast enough rate that i don't get accused of doing nothing all the time."
"What drives you to work so hard and produce so quickly? (Love your work, by the way! It brings me a smile. Thank you.)?",because no matter how fast i work it still feels like there is nowhere near enough stuff.
Are you thinking of doing 'History of ...' for each country? It would be a big help for me to study my History revision for the upcoming test. It's really funny and easy to remember?,that would probably take 100 years. i will try to have them all ready in time for your test.
Would you like some help in making things? That way more things can come out faster and some of us could feel like we have meaning in our lives maybe?,.
Or maybe you might perform solo arrangements of some of your compositions? (Something like i'm crazy / it's raining for solo piano might sound pretty good.)?,maybe but there will be a band.
PLEASE MAKE MORE THINGS I LOVE EM ALL THANKS?,i am making them as fast as i can.
"in hoj, painting with less colors... is it not 'fewer' as colors can be counted?","by that logic, i should have used way more capitalization, and not switched wildly between past/present tense all the time."
did you know twelve plus one is an anagram of eleven plus two?,yes.
i cannot even shift-enter in this box to get a new line?,"new lines never worked on this page anyway. but i am considering implementing it, in the future."
Are there a lot of questions you skip because you're like 'I'm gonna get scrutinized no matter how I answer this'?,"yes, most of them."
Will u endorse my brand?,"only if it happens to be a product i already use, and if the pay and terms are right."
"To get more stuff finished in ever category, maybe after this week you could only do songs that are already a certain percentage done? Just a thought. Judging from the reality videos I imagine you've thought about this a lot already. Best of luck?",i was doing that in 2014 but the problem with that is none of the newer/stronger songs come out.
how certain are you that you'll find The One?,less and less every day.
"Do you have in plans anything more ambitious than hotewig? If not, do you think you ever will?","yes, i am planning to find a way to make a reasonable amount of content of a variety of types, of a reasonable size, at a reasonable rate. this is unfortunately extremely ambitious. evidently impossible, no matter how fast i work and how many corners i cut."
Will you try to upload more regularly?,i am making content as fast as i can and uploading it immediately when it is done. in order to increase the frequency i would need to decrease the length or quality drastically. i'm not sure if that is what you want.
"6.20.17  7:03 pm you answered i'm not sure what you mean. this is your usual answer whenever someone refers to your music as joke music. i don't think anyone thinks it in the negative sense, but your music certainly exudes a humorous, joking feel. you can't be serious when you say that you don't understand that, right? comparing art is usually pointless, but for example, would you not say that Radiohead's music (for example) has a lot more serious tone and message compared to your music? with lyrics like i'm a movie star you can't expect people to not think that you're aiming for humor. all that said, your stuff is great, i just wanted to ask you why you refuse to accept your musical style with specific wording and just evade all attempts at classification?","i am very serious about creating something that is enjoyable and meaningful to watch or listen to. if we have to call everything either a joke or serious then this would seriously be no fun, and also not meaningful. if movie star is a joke then i guess i don't get what the joke is. although the song does use fiction. many songs use fiction/metaphors etc, such as 'i am the walrus' etc."
"bill, i think there's a number of us that don't want you to collab with anyone because your strange lonesome uniqueness is why we're here in the first place. thx?",oh nice.
have people asked to collab with you?,oh hell yeah.

i want to sing along in my car so everyone knows i'm a hardcore wurtz fan?,go to my website and click 'other categories' that is the first step to becoming a hard core fan.
where is the song california explicit? it's marked explicit on apple music for some reason?,there is actually a very quiet word 'fuck' during one of the verses. this is also true in 'we could just get high'.

Why did you leave so quickly at the shorty awards?,i thought i left at a reasonable pace.
Can u show us ur face ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)?,i already have hundreds of times. maybe you could show me yours for once.
did you expect the history of the world video to blow up as much as it did?,"i thought it was a likely possibility, but you can never guarantee these things."
would a hypothetical concert of yours include banter between each song or would you just jump into the next track continuously?,"maybe a mix of both, with some surprises."
you used microtonality on qualities of a good leader?,"i wouldn't call it that because the word microtonality is usually associated with an artificially constructed 24 tone chromatic scale. that recording is actually just using the regular 12 tone tempered tuning scale, and wavering the pitch bend wheel a little while playing."
"what made you decide to go for music? ever thought of using your intelligence to perhaps improve the world in a more practical and obvious way? i mean you're already making this world so much better but, you know, just a thought:)?","yes i thought of that. that's why at a young age i began looking for other things to add to my tool kit. such as words, ideas, concepts, and more! now the music is even more useful, because it makes all those things even more powerful."
what made you decide to do music?,i don't remember.
how many times did you mention canada on hotewig?,more times than i mentioned many other places.
Why are you not a teacher? :D?,teaching jobs do not pay well and have too many restrictions. i prefer to teach more freely. sometimes it's more fun to hide the lessons.
Do you still do the anagrams?,oh hell yeah.
Hey bill. You are awesome and a huge role model of mine. I really love your song new cannan. Do you think you will continue to make longer (ish) songs like that. Keep it real and watch movies all day till you puke?,"my current target length is between 30 seconds and 3min30. my current target time frame for completion is 1 week per song. not much time for anything else unfortunately, until i learn to do it faster."

do you do all the graphics in your vids?,yes.
or does a pal help you sometimes?,no.
"You expressed that you prefer adding chords into your music after you write a melody with lyrics,?",that's not true.
how to find a soulmate?,"just be yourself. if that doesn't work, keep doing it."

where is the universe i think im lost?,it's right here.
You said that you just updated notes but when I go to notebook the latest notes are from last year??? (I'm pretty sure I can see some updated ones in expert mode but not in notebook)?,the ones i added were much older.
What are you working on right now? Can you tell us about it please?,it is a song.
Is there a new song coming up?,oh hell yeah i will be doing songs til the cows come home.
what did you do on june 12 2014?,probably work on the napkins video.
Hey bill. Doing you think you will continue to put music in ITunes. (p.s. New Cannan is my favorite song ever)Bye?,"all the new songs will go on itunes, etc. and i will probably sneak some older ones in too."
what's the difference between 12 am and pm?,usually about 12 hours.
oh no. saw how you do lyrics melody and chords at the same time and i've been writing songs this whole time with just lyrics and a melody and trying to fit chords in after the fact and its always been so hard for me to do that. but if i find success in doing that what should I do with maybe 30-40 songs fragments or completed that only have lyrics and a melody in them and no chords?,"the lyric and melody is really the important part. and the chords are already there, you just have to find them. it's kind of like you drew a doctor but you forgot the clothes. it's easy to figure out what kind of clothes they should be wearing, it should be doctor's clothes (probably)."
BILL ARE YOU DEAD WHY DID YOU STOP ANSWERING QUESTIONS?,because i'm trying to finish the song on time which still may be impossible but i hope it is.
"Hey bill, how do you deal with people that are wrong? Not just I asked for a cappucino not a burger wrong, but I live my life only to produce the world's best cappucinos, while the obvious choice is to produce the world's best burgers? I hope that makes sense?",i'm not sure how you would know whether someone else's life decisions are wrong.
how many variations of the umbrella do you have?,"youtube, twitter, vine (not currently online), spotify, patreon, twitch, discord, vidme. i might have used the same one for some of those last ones."
when will you post more content?,i do it all the time. when will you start noticing.
How did you get the umbrella icon on Spotify? I thought you had problems with that. -Bogg?,"it used to be impossible, but many people on this page informed me that they recently started allowing artists to have more control over their profile, and someone gave me instructions on how to do it. thank you to that person. now if only someone could figure out how to get on pandora."
Trying to reach you for a Paramount tv series?,here is my.
What are your opinions on opinions?,
Why don't you ever show drums in your live music videos?,"because you can't play drums in a video without actually making drum sounds in the building you are in, in real life, which happens to be extremely loud and can be heard for miles. i hope that makes sense."
Do you experience emotions?,"yes, maybe even too much."
why do you type in lower case only?,
Where do you record? Somewhere legit like a fancy studio or just your bedroom etc?,
explain conciousness to me?,it's you wanting to know.
is a songwriter someone who has meticulously studied songs and all the boring stuff that makes you better or anyone who has ever written a song?,"i think if you have written at least 2 songs and you plan to write more, then you can be considered a songwriter, if you want."
Is your whole site in comic sans or is it my default font ?also hi?,it must be your default font. this site doesn't use any fonts except for maybe the expert mode link on the front page.
Why 240?,
how long do you think a tiger will take to eat the whole universe?,forever.
Can we be best friends?,sure.
Since when did hats stop being bad?,i have not been keeping track of whether hats are bad. surely each person can evaluate hats on a hat to hat basis.
"have you considered combining some of the song ideas on your list to get through it more effectively? i mean, if they were deemed worthy to write down for posterity, they're certainly already good ideas and concepts, and putting these ideas together might also streamline the writing process a bit?","in my experience, combining songs is not a good strategy. each song has its own very unique needs and it is important to consider exactly what that song needs in order to make it the strongest song. combining 2 halfwritten songs would be kind of like combining 2 half built houses and hoping it makes sense. although i suppose it may work for some people, and i think that's great. the last time i revealed here that i don't combine songs someone got mad at me. so it is important to emphasize the fact that other people may have success in doing that but it is not something that i think makes sense for me."
"Don't get me wrong-I love your history videos, but the short, quick style of your songs is great. I feel like people don't appreciate your songs as much as they like your history videos-just a thought. -Bogg?",
"how far along was next tuesday's song when you selected it?also this is just a side comment but i'm just blown away by the and i know you're probably wondering who you are line in movie star, i'm astonished you came up with that, let alone an amazing full song, in a week?","this week's song was in exactly the same shape as movie star, it was just one chorus line. finished the writing on tuesday, length is about 2:35. i honestly don't know how it will be possible to finish this one on time this week. movie star was major crunch time and i think this one is slightly behind schedule from where i was last week. i blame the fact that i divided my time on monday between other projects such as reality updates, notes updates, getting my image to spotify, various other things, including [WRITING A NEW VIDEO]. and the punishment is that i might have screwed the chances of finishing the song on time. i suppose that's what i get for trying to do things other than songs."
You've said you use a voice recorder to replace writing with sheet music but i don't understand how you actually get all of the information on that page into a recording? do you go through the melody and then go through again and say all the chords? Also if possible could you upload an example of one of these (a song thats finished of course)?,oh.
"i understand that you don't want searching for better and better sounds all the time to get in your way of just writing and recording, but don't you want to transcend a lot of cultural elements that have no distinct purpose to you that you were born into? like approximating the way notes fit together in harmony by using the equal temperament tuning? i dont mean like retune your keyboards, but when talking about microtonal music, i usually tend to think of tuning chords to the harmonic series, rather than the piano. i just hope you actively do that when you can instead of using an easier way all the time to get more content finished. after all you do seem like quite the creativity purist. hell im sure you've thought about it tho. nevermind. you don't need to respond to this im just rambling cause i get triggered when you say no to microtonal music. ur right, splitting half notes in half again doesn't really make that much sense?","ah, you are suggesting that i pursue the 'perfect' tuning, instead of using equal temperment tuning. this sounds like a righteous idea, but i have to tell you that i embarked on a viscious mission (in about january 2011 i believe) to get to the bottom of this situation. i set out to get a perfect tuning that at least worked in 1 key. after many hours (days? i don't remember) of experimentation, what i found surprised me. you actually can't do it. even to play within 1 key, you need to compromise. let me see if i can explain it: start by tuning a C chord properly (so that the E is a true harmony with C, and the G is a true 5th from C.) So let's get our F, that's gonna be a true 5th down from C, right? now A should be a pure major third above F, for sure. and B should surely be a pure major 3rd above G. now what should D be? you would assume that it would be a pure ninth from C (i.e. the frequency times 9 and then divided back down the octaves) which is good for the G chord also because it will be a 5th away from G. looks great, so now you've got C, D, E, F, G, A, B. but what you find next might come as a shock. D minor sounds like a nightmare. because D to A is supposed to be a 5th and now it is a very very wrong 5th. because you tuned your A to be a harmonically pure major 3rd away from F. no matter how you slice it, you inevitably run into the same argument where a 3rd needs to be a purely harmonic 3rd, but also needs to be a series of 5ths. i juggled the possibilities all around for at least a day, and i was completely stunned to find out that the essence of music, and specifically the way the secondary notes (let's say in a major key, the secondary notes are D, F, A, and also G, and the primary notes are C,E,G. that's right, G is both, the universe is a love paradox, get used to it) the secondary notes need equal tempered tuning to work right. there are surely many different ways to look at this and i made up the primary and secondary classifications for this example, but the point is that there will always be overlap. you will never have 2 exclusive sets of notes. it stems from the fact that the D note needs to be able to relate to G, but also needs to relate to the A, but the A also needs to relate to the F, and the F also definitely needs to relate to the C. now you might say ok, tune them differently depending on what chords you're using. but that really doesn't work right, because music needs all these notes to coexist. you're not going to just expect that Dmin and Fmaj will never need to blend together with the A held over. or that Dmin and Gmaj will never need to blend together with the D held over. At the end of this mind exploding journey, i basically found that it seems to be summed up perfectly in 2 chords. Cmaj, and like any combination of D,F,A, and G perhaps with G in the bass. in that 'secondary' chord, all in one moment, (which is the 'less' stable of the 2 chords when they are used in a musical context) that chord encapsulates the dual nature of the way these harmonies are working. is the F in that chord supposed to relate mainly to the C? or is it supposed to relate to the D in a pure minor third? and similarly, is the D supposed to relate to the G? the answer is, all 3 of these relationships are supposed to hold together. but this is mathematically impossible to happen exactly. so the entire essence of that Dmin, or 5dom7(sus if you like?) whatever, 'secondary' chord, the entire essence of that chord is that it contains different relationships that have to all sound like they work and yet they could never all 3 work exactly. the chord needs compromise in order to work. perhaps that is why it feels like the secondary chord or the 'less stable' or the 'i'm just waiting to go back to C' chord. realizing this changed me, because i was always told that equal tempered tuning was mainly used as a compromise to play in all 12 keys. but what i realized is you actually need it just to play in 1 key. like, just to play a 1 and a 2min. just to play the most basic essence of a key and have it work with itself. it really made me appreciate that 'secondary' chord (Dmin, G, etc) the D to F and the D to G relationship on kind of an earth shattering spiritual level, it's like the damn thing has heartbreak built right in. what you think you are hearing is the d to f relationship and the d to g relationship and the f to c relationthip, etc, all at the same time, when really it could never be, at least not exactly. but it is close enough to feel it. basically ever since this experiment i have had a wildly new appreciation for how and why music works, on an even more 'human' level than i expected. and i never questioned equal tempered tuning again."
How many albums do you think all your songs could fit in?,it depends how big you think an album should be.
"why do you use inverted/slash chords in gonna chase myself through hell and other works? how do you see them as useful? (not that i don't, just wondering)?",i just use the notes and chords i think best support the song or video at that moment. whether or not you choose to represent them with slashes is your choice.
how do you stay motivated for huge projects w/o burning out?,"it helps if you are confident that it's the right project, and also if you are confident in the process. a good way to work yourself up to that is to do a series of much shorter projects, which get done much more easily, and each one is a chance to learn new tricks and refine the process."
You said the chorus to movie star was written in dec 2015. I was under the impression that back then you were working on history of japan. I was also under the impression that you always do a project as quickly as possible to move on to the next thing.What do you have to say in your defense?(jk bill i love u keep doing your thing)?,"sometimes it is important to do 2 projects at the same time. the 'movie star' hook was written on a vine writing session, which also yielded 'hate myself', 'clean my room', 'made some bread in my head', and several others. sometimes the hooks i come up with seem like they might be better as a long song, so they are saved for later. 'movie star' was one of those. the purpose of the session was to generate more material for vines. the 2 projects i was doing at the time were history of japan and maintaining daily vine uploads. i hope that makes sense."
is answering questions a part of your daily routine?,yes.
what is a good pseudonym?,santa claus.
i just realised it is better to be nice than to not be nice?,there is confusion sometimes because some people think different things are nice.
where can we fan-mail you?,
"I was reading your questions in class earlier today and one of them was lit up in green so I clicked it and it blared out I like music, I like music or something, point is you got me in trouble?",i think you need to better understand how to keep your phone silent on the internet.
hey you should try and imagine music videos that would take much less time to produce and then try and make one to see if it works?,"i have always considered it. but nowadays i feel a bit trapped because so many people expect a certain quality. it would be refreshing just to do a simple lyric video, as simple as the school video for example."
"what, in your opinion, makes a person cool?",being born.
What is a word you have made up¿?,"there is one in my most recent video, 'history of the entire world i guess' actually there is probably more than one, it's a long video and i don't really remember it too well."
i like your music what i need to do if i want be popular ;ike you?,be yourself ruthlessly in a safe but publically accessible place. plan on doing it forever. you will get better at it over time and inevitably people will find you.
wanna walk through several zipcodes with me?,oh hell yeah.
"i am So anxious, i haven't been this anxious in ages but now it's washing over me and i feel powerless. does that ever happen to you? how do you deal with it? i feel like i can't even create anything i just?",try rotating things a bit.
"And not ever the actual cover of the song but an alternate, without the type? it looks like your teasing for videos again and misleading a lot of people?","i have never told anyone on instagram what any of the instagram pictures relate to. but i usually explain it very clearly here, if anyone asks."
why did you use odd time signatures for movie star (which is a great song btw)?,"i'm not sure. the original hook just sounded best with a slightly unpredictable number of beats before going back around. maybe it's the feeling that you are hanging on that second chord, and it's almost like you are waiting to become a movie star. but you're not sure when it's gonna happen. that's just my analysis after the fact."
"can u elaborate on the lyric i wanna be a movie star, most specifically the underlying meaning? like What Does It All Meanis it just an arbitrarily chosen lyric that sounded good in the song or does it have meaning beyond that? i have my own interpretation of it but i wanna know what u intended it to mean?","it was written on a vine writing session, which also yielded 'made some bread in my head,' 'i hate myself,' 'clean my room', etc. they don't really mean anything. just trying to make nice hooks. actually i was really trying to work on history of japan, but i was desperately trying to maintain my vine channel at the same time because that was where my strongest following was at the time."
send nudes?,ok.
"can you move any of your toes independently of one another? that's the feeling i think of when starting a new project. i don't really think i can do it, but start trying anyway and then get better and better at it and then BAM I'm illuminating a manuscript with my toes?","oh nice that reminds me of all the dreams i have when i realize i can actually fly just a little bit, just enough to get off the ground slightly, or even further if i just do it for a little bit longer."
why do you say nothing is funny?,"it is impossible to really determine what is funny or not. so sometimes i just say everything is funny, or nothing is funny, because i think when you look at it that way it kind of illuminates the situation a bit."
I love the lyric this looks like a twelve-figure income town. Can you explain it in a bit more depth? Thanks?,"6 figure income means your yearly income (money) has 6 digits. so like 500,000 dollars a year is a 6 figure income. 5,000,000 dollars a year would be a 7 figure income. that lyric is from the song new canaan, which tells the story of an aimless exploratory trip to a random town accessible via the New York transit system. one of the most immediately notable traits of the town is that it seems to be a really rich town. a '6-figure income town' would be a town where people with a 6-figure income might live. 12-figures is surely an exaggeration, but it seemed to be the number that fit the best in the song at that time."
"you said in one of your reality videos that you may flop over from exhaustion and might have to quit vine. how do you feel now that vine is fully dead? considering it's one of the platforms that got you popular, do you miss it or are you glad it's gone so that you can focus  on other projects? tell me ur thoughts bill?",
"at 6.10.17  7:58 pm you said the song you're most proud of is 'i wanna be a movie star' but i cant find it anywhere. have you not recorded it yet?also if you go on tour plsssssss go to the uk and not just to london, somewhere closer to the north if that is possible. actually it would probably be a waste of your time so whatever?",i get asked a lot which of my songs is my 'favorite' or which one i am 'most proud of' and i really don't look at it that way. i may have answered movie star because that is the one i was currently working on. it is done and it will be coming out tomorrow (tuesday).
what flavor of music do you find most unique?,"i'm not keeping track of which flavor is which, because you are allowed to change the flavors, and that's actually part of the whole fun anyway."
Stop saying Oh hell yeah?,how else am i going to indicate that i strongly agree with something.
Speed Bumps or Speed Humps. Need it for a crazy school assignment?,where i'm from they call them speed bumps.
"are you gonna do videos for any of the new songs? (california, I love you)?",that would be nice but i am considering an alternative option which is MORE SONGS.
"I can't ask a question because I don't have internet. Please help, I don't have a computer either. -Bogg?",you seem to be asking questions with success.
"You seem like a smart person that manages to mix inspiration, music, humor, and randomness in your works, and I love that. Like, it make me think wow, when I grow up, I want to be him. So after this kinda lengthy introduction, here's my question: Why do you make your works so short? It kinda makes me sad, because it feels like you have so much potential, with all the music you make n' stuff, demonstrated in History of Japan and hotewig?",
"I've been reading the fuckkig pages obsessively for days now, i think i'm ready to apply for the question answering job on here, if the position is open?",please get in touch.

Is it true that life as a terminal STD?,i never thought of it that way. you could also think of it like a fun adventure.

"Hey, I keep getting an arpeggio and an archipelago mixed up, what's the best way to remember the difference? Thank you?","an archipelago is the one that contains the letter L, because it is made of Land."
"Since your huge success, have you considered making a team or have some form of help from plebs? You should have them to make even more content of your own, just keep it secret. PLS I JUST WANT MORE STUFF FROM YOU ;_;?","i want to do that but i have no idea how i would go about doing it. it would be so different from the way i normally work. there are many complications, and i think it would put more pressure to make more money quicker."
thoughts on capital letters?,
"Bill, I already watched history of the entire world, i guess. One thing that you didn't mention was Ferdinand Magellan. Maybe after sometime after Columbus discovered the indies and japan (let's draw a line to see who gets which hal of the world). Anyway, after all that, he wanted ro find the indies and ended up here, in the Philippines. He got killed by Lapu-Lapu. Why not mention that? Also, the only time I saw you mentioning the Philippines is we've got business and America goes there. That's all I could think of. Your bideos are great! ♪~ ᕕ(ᐛ)ᕗ?",

"hey bill, i'm not sure if you're aware, but spotify recently opened up verification to all artists. you have to apply for Spotify for Artists and it takes like a week for them to accept you.i was able to verify my profile without going through my aggregator, and i have like 2 followers or something stupid. you should be able to do it i think.this would allow you to get a profile/background pic (though you still have to go through Rovi for the description info)?","i am verified, but last i checked the picture has to come through rovi. it is frustrating to deal with, everything is delayed, and all the instructions are always very friendly and smiley while also telling you that you're not really allowed to do anything. i'm just thankful that i found a way to get my music up there at all."
Why are all of your headers misspelled? like thabk you and ueqstions?,graphics free title graphics.

Why don't you put ads on the videos? That way you can buy yourself a brand new used car?,that would be a drag on the viewing experience.
'it was not made yet at that time''But you held the award in your hand?,"that was a blank one. i had to hand it back, so they could give it to the next person."
"I'm surprised you didn't mention the Trojan War in the hotew,ig video and the subsequent book titled The Iliad being released (which was basically the equivalent of the bible in the ancient world), when briefly touching upon the topic of the Mycenaean Greeks. Is this because you don't believe in the validity of a Trojan War having occured (albeit without divine intervention), or because you couldn't fit it into the video? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hisarlik?",

you seem to answer questions at all hours - do you sleep? (asked by someone who can't sleep and or can't wake up)?,
Why is history of the entire world I guess in 25 frames per second?,seems reasonable to me. why does your question have 66 characters.
"Do you Know how many people have visited this website? Because I think it's cool,but unpopular?","it is popular, i get a lot of offers from advertisers who want to put their ads here."
"It took me a while to find my question answered here. Are you sure you can't make something a bit more organized? Great aesthetic, though :D?",i think it is organized in a way that makes sense. but for your convenience i have made your question much larger than everyone else's.

"why do you have two different world history videoshistory of the world and history of the entire world, i guess?","a similar reason to why you have used some of the same letters multiple times in your question, in different ways."

hi bill how do you stay committed to a project so long without getting demotivated to a point of quitting?,"it helps if you are confident that it's the right project, and also if you are confident in the process. a good way to work yourself up to that is to do a series of much shorter projects, which get done much more easily, and each one is a chance to learn new tricks and refine the process."
"also do you continue writing new songs while recording these songs? (i mean writing completely from scratch, so not the songs that you had to finish writing)?",.

was guessing the majapahit's name as mapajahit twice in hotewig intentional?,"no, i actually meant to do all 6 combinations. i am embarrassed that i screwed it up. i guess it was just cause i was working so fast."
"I found it kind of funny that you were like, Oh, no, not another weed song when in california was selected. I had the same thought when I heard it. Nonetheless, it is a great song.But that's beside the point. You've previously touched on the idea that you have different periods in your songwriting. For instance, you mentioned that songs written in spring/summer of 2009 like new canaan have a traveling feeling. Since we probably won't hear a song that you have recently written for a while (unless the randomizer picks it),?","actually the current song is a hook from late 2015, which i have written the remaining 90% of this week."
do u regret working so much on vine to have the app be shut down?,everything i accomplished on vine still stands. i moved on from vine about a year before it was cancelled.

On what specific date will you post your next video on youtube that is over 10 minutes long?,"not too interested in doing videos that long. they take so many months to make, and i am only going to be alive for maybe a few more decades."
"did you get the idea for that extra twist of telling yourself you don't actually have to release anything from those last few weeks of working on hotewig, when you (kinda?) considered not releasing the video?","no, that is completely different. this new technique is something that helps starting out on a project, not finishing it. once the project is more than half done, it becomes clear that it is gonna be posted. what you are talking about with history of the world was a different thing, that was because i was losing my mind from all the harassment i was getting to post the video now and fuck you where's my video and you suck, where's the fuckin video etc. etc. for so many months."
why is dick size such a popular question?,i guess it is important.
"two questions, if you don't mind :)1. i want to do everything. i want to do lots of different stuff, i want to do maths, english, history, music, art, programming and loads of other shit but I can't do all of it. what do i do?2. i am really lazy, and even though i have a lot of potential i waste it and don't put all of my effort into projects. how do i fix this?thank you bby?","try to organize the things you want to do (this might not be entirely possible, but give it your best shot.) then start doing a series of very small projects. try to make up a schedule, maybe do 5 things a week, monday through friday, circling through the different categories. the short projects will be much easier to get done, and you will automatically start learning tricks and techniques very fast. your work will get better, and soon you will have everything it takes to move on to longer projects."
Have you ever gone on a date with someone that asked you out via ueqstions page?,no.

"i don't want to be rude but it would be nice if the notebook page read like the questions page, all in a big stream so you didn't have to click back and forth. that's probably a lot of editing though and not your biggest concern, sorry just a thought?",they would blend together too much that way. but i am considering setting up something with next and previous buttons.

"this answer will determine the rest of my life: should I leave my degree and start studying to become a professional guitar player?anyway any answer will determine the rest of my life, even no answer at all, so feel free to answer just saying lettuce. also I love your content?","to become a professional guitar player, studying will not help you get gigs. but getting gigs will make you a better guitar player, and it will also lead you to more gigs. and if you're getting better then you might be able to keep better gigs. i'm not sure if thst answers your question."
I'll bring you to the best ice cream place in town?,i think i would prefer to do something a little more constructive.

you surely answer questions alot arent you tired of them?,
"i see  a lot of questions about being your apprentice. while that sounds far fetched, would you please at least consider making some videos/text on this site about how you create your content? it could be as detailed as you wish, but any glimpse into your process would be fun to see. even if it was just one song from beginning to end it would be awesome. what are your concerns about this?-boss hogg?","there is already a little bit of that stuff, but i would like to do even more."
How can u carry on when u r depressed?,"don't carry on. stop, and throw a party."
"if you ever got access and skills using a professional studio, would you bother remaking some of your old hits? not to mean they don't already sound great, and you know i don't know anything, but i imagine there is some extra magic you could add with the best tools out there?","re-recording old songs would always be nice. but there are hundreds more songs that have not yet been recorded at all. out of all the many things i desperately want to do, re-recording songs is maybe the 22nd priority."
"So on Instagram you posted a picture of a rotated, purple, California shaped outline against a black background. The picture implies to many of your fans, including me, that you have started work on a music video for your most recent song, In California. However, on the 6.1.17 11:21 pm question you said In California would not be getting a video. And on the 6.2.17 6:16 am question you were asked about the topic of the next video to which you replied, what video. So these questions imply to your fans that you aren't making a video at all and are starting on the next song project. But that still leaves the question: If you're not making a video then what was the Instagram photo from? (Sorry, btw, if I am completely off about all of this and you have been repeating the answer throughout my question.)?","the instagram picture was posted right before the song was released, as a subtle indication of the upcoming release of the song. the graphic was made specifically for instagram, but i also used it in the title graphic for the song."
for the videos that go with the songs do the dates correspond to when they were filmed or when the songs were recorded?,the date the video was completed and/or first released as a video.

Why do you take so long to make videos. Do you do something outside of YouTube. Sorry if it's a dumb question I'm just curious?,"have you considered making your own videos to see if you could do it faster, and maybe better too."
"Hey Bill, the question at 6.1.17  11:59 am (why no Tuesday videos yet) is referring to your answer to a question at 5.26.17  1:46 pm, where you replied i'm hoping to have [the videos] done every tuesday, for a very long time. Did you mean something different when you said that? (BTW this isn't the same person, I'm just curious about it as well)?","that is an accurate quote, except for the part in brackets. you added that."
