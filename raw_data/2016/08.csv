question,answer
what's the story behind the 'no castle' video?,"i tried to make a video to a song with no lyrics. with no solid lyrical content to latch on to, i had to resort to teddy bears, horses, and john travolta."
would you rather wear pants or have friends?,"both, maybe even at the same time."
do you play any videogames?,
"How do you come up with your lyrics? Do they actually hold any meaning, or are they totally random? For example: Jingle bells, I'm a copI realize some songs may be of different nature than others, but I'm talking about the little short ones.","the origin of lyrics can be vastly different from song to song. so all i can really do is explain the example you mentioned. i guess i just figured it was an interesting surprise, because you don't usually expect the cops to show up in the 1st line of jingle bells."
can one appreciate something without understanding it? eg art?,"sure. for example, i appreciate this question."
is my handwriting good?,maybe.
it seems like humans tend to organize numbers in 10s because we have 10 fingers. any thoughts why rhythmic beats are usually grouped in 4s?,"yes, i think the important number is actually 2. multiply it by itself a few times and you will see all those standard beat and bar quantities  (2, 4, 8, 16, etc). Besides powers of 2, the next number that seems to play by far the most significant role in rhythms, melodies, (and our minds in general!) is 3. Also i should mention, another number that plays a huge role particularly in songwriting, and story telling in general, and is often overlooked, is the number 1."
what's with all of the jail themed text posts in your notebook? Shady past?,"i guess the idea of jail seems funny to me. you want to go everywhere, and yet you can't go anywhere."

Why do you sometimes ask follow-up questions even though there isn't really a way for the person who originally asked the question to answer your follow-up questions?,"sometimes questions just lead to other questions before they lead to answers. the fact that there is no back and forth dialogue on this page is a separate issue. but it is important to remember that back and forth dialogue has actually occured here, with special formatting, on at least a few occasions."
"don't questions that try to be random, nonsensical, and/or weird in a failed attempt at humour annoy you?","everything is annoying until you realize that the things that annoy you actually don't annoy you, but are instead a vibrant and rejuvenating source of life."
why bother answering some of these questions if you aren't actually going to give a helpful answer?,why bother visiting this page if you don't find value in it.
has science gone too far?,i am not sure how far it was supposed to go.

"Hey Bill, music means everything to me. I'm 15 year old drummer, have a passion for big band jazz, and I have my first gig with a proffesional big band soon. But I also have a passion for science and math. College is coming up pretty soon for me and I don't know which road to take. I know I shouldn't ask other people on what to do with my life, so what would you do?","i will give you the same advice that was given to me, which is absolutely no advice. it may not seem helpful, but it is exactly what led me to be who i am today."
"If you want to fill a measure that has five counts with one continuous note, can you tie a whole note to a quarter note to fill the whole measure?","sure, although i think it would be nicer to use a half note and dotted half note, in whichever order best represents the meter feel of the song (2+3 or 3+2)."
Is a double dotted half note just a lazy version of a whole note when there isn't even an eighth note at the end of the measure?,"to draw a double dotted half note, you basically need to draw a whole note PLUS you have to add a stem, 2 dots, AND an eighth note rest afterwards. it's hard to argue that that is the 'lazier' option."
What if I told you that all the questions you've been answering have been from the same person?,

"bill i need some advice. I'm seriously thinking about dropping college because i don't like what i'm studying is complete bullshit. I have come to the conclusion that what i really want to do is animation (cartoons and stuff like that) I've always had talent at drawing but I'm so scared the future is so uncertain... maybe I'm not good enough, maybe I'll have to apply again for university but just thinking about doing again the access exam gives me headaches... What should I do to be succesfull in what I want to do without having any degree or formation whatsoever? Thank you and sorry if this question is too long...","i will give you the same advice that was given to me, which is absolutely no advice. it may not seem helpful, but it is exactly what led me to be who i am today."

can you finish your video before yellowstone comes out i dont want you to die without making that video?,"i am working as fast as humanly possible, as always. there is nothing else i can do. i probably want to finish it more urgently than you do, so in that sense, you and i are in the same situation. except the differnce is, you get to sit around and relax while i have to make the video, in addition to worry about my concerns that it is not going fast enough, and also worry about your concerns about it not going fast enough."
Have you experimented with notes not conventionally used in Western music? Such as quarter steps and other notes that could be produced on an instrument such as a viola or a trombone that some would call Out of tune?,"it is important to remember that 'quarter tones' are not used in eastern music either. the idea was proposed in europe as a mental experiment, and in my opinion does not have any basis in musical reality. using all pitches freely is very legit, and it happens all the time in speaking, or sounds in nature, everywhere. but the idea of dividing it evenly into 24 is not useful, in my opinion."
"which rule has been hardest to not follow? like, with there are no rules, are there any rules you have trouble not instinctively following?",no rules doesn't mean you are not allowed to follow a rule. it just means you don't have to.
"I know that you didn't/don't like the prospect of a video that's longer than 10-15 minutes, but I'm all about it.

Do you think lawn mowers sound particularly musical?,sure.
How important is it to finish songs when you have no idea what you are doing?,"it is very important. the reason is: uncertainty can and will strike at any time. songwriting is such an open game, and anything can happen. if you start getting the idea that it is ok to give up, you will probably never get anywhere. the crazy tricks you will invent to overcome uncertainty are what is going to give your songs character. if you are afraid to think like that, then you are not even in the game."
What do you do when you don't know how the next part of a song should go?,"clear your mind, and do accurate, timed run throughs! i usually do it with a click. and if i really get stuck, i do a 'door touch' to try to re-set my mind. i walk over to the door and touch the door knob and walk back to my seat and then play the song, all the way through. the more you can re-set your mind, the more accurate picture you will have of the song after doing a full run through. after doing an accurate timed run through, you will start to get a vision of an answer somewhere within the last few seconds of the known song, and it may linger within the first few seconds after you stop. it will start to fade after that. the whole secret is to pay very very close attention in this moment, and try to gather as much info as possible about the situation, (of course you might get lucky and lightening might strike and you might find the whole solution instantly) but try to play process of elimination -- sometimes you might find out you 'definitely don't want another chorus' or you 'definitely want something with the same chords' or you 'definitely want something different' or you 'definitely want something the same' .... try to listen to as many clues as you can find, to narrow it down, ... and then clear your mind and do another run through. don't forget that if you already have 'critical mass' in the song, you are never obligated to do anything more, the only thing you are obligated to do is 'carry the song home', which might even mean ending it sooner than you thought. or it might mean repeating what you have. or it might mean doing something totally different. it's important to stay very open, and again, the only thing that will really produce a reliable solution is clearing your mind, and an accurate, timed run through, and paying very close attention to the moment when you reach the end of the known material. i hope that helps."
What will be your next video?,i have no idea. i will probably focus more on songs after i finish the video i am currently working on.

have you made music in a tuning that wasn't 12-tet?,"i have tried, but it is pointless. if you put Cmaj in tune, Dmin is out of tune! the entire Cmaj-Dmin dialogue is not even possible unless you use equal tempered. without equal temperment, you can't even play in 1 key let alone change keys. it didn't occur to me how important it is."

Not this auto tune and all done with a computer shit?","hating what's popular has been popular for thousands of years. i really don't take pop-hate seriously anymore, especially because everyone who does it always points to some period of time 20 years ago when everything was great. and then 20 years later, people hate the new pop and refer to the previous pop (which had been equally hated in its own time) as great."

how quickly can you tell what note is being sung? are you calculating it's interval from a reference note you know very well in your head or do you just know exactly what the note is the moment you hear it?,"my relative skills vastly overshadow the absolute. i was not trained to care about the absolute from a young age, but as a result of learning everything in C, i do actually have C built in. it is a strange paradox, and in the last several years i have started to feel entitled to having the absolute, knowing that it must be possible due to the overwhelming reality of accurate song and sound memory. so i have over the years strengthened the framework to the point where overall i can pretty much claim to have the absolute, at least as well as anyone else who makes that claim. and the relative remains lightening fast, and is further strengthened by some of the absolute strategies i have. it is important to remember that the absolute is not an important musical skill."

i had a keyboard for a long time that had dynamic sensitivity but could only play a small number of notes at once (i think 4). do you think having the ability to play more than 4 simultaneous notes is less important than dynamic volume to the point where you would be happy to recommend such a keyboard to someone?,"that's a great question. honestly i do recommend a polyphony of at least 16, or else you might end up in some confusing situations when you are trying to learn chords and stuff."

recommendations for a beginners keyboard?,"the only thing that matters is whether it can tell the difference between a loud and soft note. test it by hitting it hard and see if the note is louder than when you hit it soft. get a keyboard as cheap as you want, but make sure it has this otherwise your whole life will be ruined. (some of the cheap ones don't have it). it is called 'dynamic sensitivity' and if a keyboard doesn't have it, even a perfectly good player will mysteriously sound like a toddler. it's not even fair. it would be like having only one volume for your voice-- you go to whisper in someone's ear, it comes out normal speaking volume. you are being attacked by wolves and you cry for help, and it comes out in a normal speaking volume. this would cripple your ability to express yourself, and the same thing would happen if you had a keyboard without dynamic sensitivity. don't make that mistake. again, you don't have to get an expensive keyboard, you just need to test it to make sure loud and soft notes are a thing."
"You answered my 8.21.16/1:39 shit, but what I now want to know is: do you find it trickier to write lyrics, or music? Do you just do the whole thing organically, or do you sometimes have lyrics without music; music without lyrics?",

(so that makes it C+7#9). and for DIES, i am hearing more of a straight C7, including E, and G. (and still Bb) and i also am feeling the presence still of Eb (or maybe even Db) dirtying it up just a bit, which would mean either C7#9 or C7b9, but the presence of that note is extremely subtle (as well it should be) and might possibly just be the reverb ringing over from the previous chord.  so OL is Caug7#9 and 'dies' is C7 with possible very subtle #9. the melody and bass notes are much stronger than the harmony notes, as they should be."

"That question about a440 made me curious about an aspect of having perfect pitch (which I do not have)When I hear a note that is sharp or flat relative to its accompaniment it makes me feel very uncomfortable. I find myself straining as though I could correct the pitch with my thoughts alone -- much in the same way I might lean to one side to try to influence an errant bowling ball after it has left my hand.Do you ever get this feeling?  If so, does it only occur for you when the tone is out of tune relative to the musical context?  Or, having perfect pitch, does it also happen for you if the music is in tune with itself, but not with the traditional a440 tuning?","anyone who claims to be 'irritated' when a recording is fully in tune with itself, but not tuned to a440, is faking it. this is not irritating, it's just a way to brag about having perfect pitch. even worse, many people who do this are actually wrong about it-- they will tell you the radio is out of tune because they speed up the songs to get more ads in, but that is not true anymore, now they can speed up the songs without changing the pitch, so everything you hear on the radio is in a440, for the most part."

"you keep answering questions like 'how many of these questions do you answer?' with the same answer of(i'm paraphrasing) I get a bunch ton of questions dude over 14,000 , you figure it out. but there's nothing past '5.10.15  11:50 pm'. Are there answers do questions before then or do you want people to just add up the questions answered to that point(meaning those who asked/care)?","i am not sure exactly what you are asking, but i barely have time to answer as many questions as i do, and i am asked frequently about the percentage, and i certainly don't have time to count. it is much easier for me to see the total of questions i have received, and anyone can take it upon themselves to count the ones i have answered in that range of time. before 3.31.16, this questions page didn't exist and i was running it through ask.fm, and i started on ask.fm around 5.10.15. before that there was no questions page. whenever i tell people total numbers of questions received, i always specify a range so they can calculate an accurate percentage, and it never goes back before 3.31.16 because i don't have a good way of counting the received questions from ask.fm. also, the questions you see on this page before that date are not actually all the ones i answered, i just hand picked a few from the ask page and converted them over. i didn't have time to do all of them. i hope that answers your question."

"this probably seems stupid given that you record with MIDI but do you think it really makes a noticeable difference, or gives any notable benefit if instruments are tuned to A at 440 vs 432 Hz?","in today's world, 95% of recorded music is at a440, and 99% of peoples' instruments are tuned to a440. while detuning songs can result in a very 'fresh' sound, it can be extremely annoying for musicians who are trying to play along to the song. so for convenience sake, i keep everything at the standard pitch. also it really does not effect the quality of the music whatsoever."

what do you think of using clash chords/tone clusters in music?,"seems legit, but only for very horrific situations. honestly you can usually get more mileage out of dissonance when you have only 2 notes next to each other (half-step away) and the others are more than a half-step away. 3 consecutive notes in a row really only works in a horror movie type situation, and starts to actually REDUCE the evilness if you have too many neighboring notes together. it does create a cool noise effect, but let's face it, as long as we're using noise, let's not limit it to musical instruments, let's start recording cars and trucks and jackhammers and shit."

"This is similar to the job question that was asked earlier - but forgive me, it may be lengthy. Let's say you've been with a company for 1 month, and someone else was also hired at the same time as you, with a similar role. The other person learned the job quicker than you, and everyone in the department seems to love that person but not you. You feel it's partly because you took longer to learn and asked a lot more questions than the other person, and now your entire department basically doesn't treat you well. Even though now you are fairly confident with your responsibilities and have been doing good work. Should you stay, or pursue a job with a better crowd of people? I feel like this department I'm with involves a complete clash of personalities between me and them. Also important to note: This job is what I went to school for and pays very well. But I feel so shut out from my department that I'm basically desiring a customer s ervice j ob now, like I used to do. Help!!!","it looks like you are in a very delicate, and close to 50/50 situation. i am familiar with those situations. at this point you are going to have to rely on very deep instincts, and/or small gusts of wind, to help inspire you in one direction or the other. hopefully  among those small gusts of wind will be new developments that may provide inspiring roads in one direction or another."
"How do come up with those really-out-there chords like in 'all about the music business', 'advice to young musicians', etc.? Are you just chaining together a bunch of random chords and just ending on something like a maj9 chord?","i carefully choose the chords based on how they 'sound' in the overall context of the music, and more importantly in the context of the material being displayed in the video. i know that might seem strange but that is how i do it."

I've learnt a lot from reading many of your answers on this page. Thank you for that.I get the recurring uneasy feeling that I need to Create Art that I need to produce something beautiful with my own hands.But I am too busy consuming things instead. There are too many books to read, songs to discover, plays/films to watch. So much to learn. And such little time. Also the stupid but inescapable notion that nothing I create will be Good Enough, and other silly reasons that I keep putting it off like the decision about which tools to focus on becoming better at playing around with first. Words? Musical instruments? Cameras?

"I used to sleep with this guy occasionally, and it was great. But it became clear that he always wanted a real relationship with me, and I wanted to keep things casual, so we drifted apart.

I could also try to break them up by pretending like I finally DO want to date him, and then just use him for sex for a while. But that option also feels wrong.

Do you think there will ever be government-implemented actions to reduce this increase, like restrictions on family size, or public awareness campaigns? What do you expect the reactions would be towards pushed legislation, and how would such arguments regarding rights and freedoms hold up against the possible detriments of reaching a point where food, water, and other resources are inadequate to support the people, leading into collapse of organized society, or government enforced regulation of food supplies and distribution?

I have recently noticed a change in style in the questions on this page. Has this change occurred in the questions themselves or simply just the ones you choose to answer?,i have not noticed any change. it seems to be very much the same as it always was.
"If I ask a question, what are the odds you'll see it and answer it?",it depends on the contents of the questions.
"are you still stressed about having to make a lot of small content? because I really think that now that you have a nice fanbase and a literal ton of views on yt you should be able to relax and focus on what do you really want to do, not what you feel like you have to do?","the point where the youtube surpassed the vine was a decisive indication that i was free to move to longer vids, which is a change that had been long overdue. however, it is still stressful that it takes so long. it is always strange to hear people say they think i've stopped when actually i am working my ass off every day."

do you see your music/songs/works as your children or is comparing it to babies just a really good way to get the point across?,both.

have you tried just writing all of it without bothering to pay attention to the time and then when you're done writing test record and then cutting/editing until you get it around your ideal time limit?,"when writing such a long video, it is actually important to record (even just a crappy version) of me speaking the script, so that i can hear how it's going. i actually do this when i'm writing anything. a side effect of this is you can see the time, but that's not the reason i do it."
"bill yesterday i decided to try and work on an old bike so i could commute on it, and so i spent several whOle days fixing it and looking up terminology and now my brain is fried and i feel like a bike expert. you ever done something like that?","sure, that's basically what my life has been like for the last 2 months."
"I write music for fun and post it online or whenever I feel like it and have the time. I haven't released much, but the ones I have released I've put a ton of time and effort into. I've gotten a few offers from indie game developers, but always ended up declining due to confidence issues and so composers much younger than me end up getting the job instead. I'll listen to their final product and notice how generic it sounds or how I'm sure I could do better, but when I'm given the opportunity to do it I run away. What is wrong with me?","the reason those other composers sound generic is because they are doing it as a job. a paid gig. if you are putting a lot of time and effort and care into what you are doing, then a paid situation is only going to drive you crazy. sure, there are 'paid' gigs for people who really care, but they pay WAY more, and you only get those gigs when you reach a more steven spielberg kind of level. these kids who are taking your gigs are working for cheap, and they don't care, and they don't have to care, because they are working for people who can't afford to pay them to care. real care is worth much, much, more than that. in fact, it's priceless. if you care, you need to take a very different approach, and find something else to do for work, and devote your true 'care' to what you really care about. in other words, if you try to sell your babies, you will only be undercut by somebody making cheaper and dumber babies. and that will be so uninspiring that it will ruin your day."
you've done really short videos and a really long video. will you do a really medium video?,i have done several medium videos (that might be my favorite length). but right now i am doing an even longer one.
If you know the exact video length so far does that mean you are already recording audio?,just dumb temp writing audio. like even more temp than the temp audio i will do when i start on the graphics. but the timing is about right.

I've written hundreds of song fragments in midi format over the years but instead of finishing them I just keep writing more. Once I get stuck I'll write a new song only to get stuck again. Most of them are like 5 to 30 seconds with the longer ones around 2 to 3 minutes. It's been several years and I only have a few finished songs released. Is there a way to break out of this habit and actually finish the older songs?,"you're going to have to decide on a system, and also decide on a release schedule, and decide on where and how they are going to be released. i could tell you more details about how i got through it, it ultimately took a few years, and actually i haven't totally made it through yet."
