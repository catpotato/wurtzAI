question,answer
So how did the picture gathering go? And is the temp stuff coming along with minimal hitches?,"pictures is all set. doing temp narration now, which i would like to think of as an in-between stage which doesn't take any time, but for fucks sake it is taking a long time. on a 19 minute video everything takes a long time. the timing on the temp narration has to be perfect, because the graphics are done over it. also did i mention there are 66 jingles. temp or not temp, that's gotta take a while even if you have a rocket pack."

how do you decide whether to use the # or b version of the same note?,"the scale is supposed to use all the letters. so in the key of D, you use the F# note instead of calling it Gb because otherwise there would be 2 G's and no F's. this theory is simple when playing with keys close to the center of the circle, and when playing simple music that mainly stays in scale. if the music gets crazier, it starts to matter less. and as you get to keys close to no-mans-land (6 flats or sharps) the rules also start to break down, and matter less, kind of like calculating time differences between new zealand and hawaii."

but i have started doing a worse job in order to get it done soonerfuck you?,"i was joking when i said that. i was trying to shed some light on the other side of the picture, amidst the unending barage of interrogation and lack of understanding as to why the video is taking so long. i feel as though people assume that i am either working slowly or not doing it. if only people could understand the round-the-clock urgency and focus that has defined the entire fabric of my existence for the duration of this project, no fuck it actually for the past several years of my life. it is like i am flying a mars mission here."

"in stringed instruments like the violin, why does the body of the violin block your hand from trying to reach the high notes?","if those notes were further to the left, they would not be as high. if the body were smaller, the instrument wouldn't be as loud. if those notes didn't exist, you probably wouldn't worry about it so much, but the more brave players would be deprived of the opportunity attempt to play them at all."

"Looking back at the description of the Japan video, you said there was 1 day on temp narration and then on to the graphics, and then jingles. Just so I'm clear, are you currently on graphics?","that's not quite what it was, but i am still not on the real 'graphics' phase. the current phase i'm still on (and will hopefully be done with in about 12 more hours!!) is kind of like a pre-graphics phase. call it 'pictures', call it 'image collection', call it 'graphics planning', call it 'phase 2', i can't figure out what to call it, and it doesn't really matter. but it involves taking what the words are, and then figuring out what exactly i am going to put in the graphics. like what am i gonna put on screen if i said *this.* a picture is worth a thousand words so it takes longer than you think. plus accuracy is really important. if an i say an earth quake happened in russia, i'm not just going to throw the earth quake in the middle of russia, i need to put it right where it actually happened. so phase 2 deals with all that stuff. including occasional re-writes, as i sometimes will realize that something in the script may be wrong or not work, and have to change it. all the re-writes are rock solid now, and another part of phase 2 is also done (which i can't really talk about right now, and is heavily related to graphics) and now i'm just finishing with pictures, at the 14 min mark as of today, moving roughly a second per minute (which is way up from before, i am setting timers every hour to track my progress and always find new techniques to really push it to the limit) but i will definitely be done with phase 2 like tomorrow. then i will lay down a temp narration for timing, and do temps for all the jingles, and put them in place so i have something to work over, and then do the real actual graphics, which will be what the video actually looks like. that took 30 days for history of japan, but this video is twice as long. the remaining tasks after that also took a total of 30 more days for history of japan, and again this video is twice as long. however, i have set a deadline for the entire video, which is approximately 33 days from now. as you can see there is a huge discrepancy from reality here. but that is how this needs to be approached. the deadline is causing me to think differently, and it is thrilling, and will at least cut the remaining production time in half, even if not the required 1/4x that would be needed to meet the deadline which is surely impossible but as i said i am still taking it seriously, i hope that answers your question."

"You might be asked like thirty times before you write a response but in case you haven't, Vine had just announced that they are discontinuing their service in the coming months. They'll keep old videos online. I remember back before History of Japan you were kinda in a love-hate relationship with Vine because it allowed you to trim and really concentrate your content, but doing so was kinda addicting(?) in a way and it sorta stagnated you from making longer videos until you made the bold move to cut Vine off entirely during HoJ production. I'm sorry if this question seems to be spiraling out of control or maybe I'm just rambling, but I'm curious to understand why Vine was an appealing outlet for your content at the time and if you've grown out of it and don't mind the discontinuation too much or if you still have some fondness for that service. Thanks for reading, regardless!","i was already making short videos (because it was a good way to get used to making videos), and about a year into it i found out there was a popular platform where the videos were supposed to be short, and they are auto-looped. so it seemed like a good decision to try to get the videos onto there. by the time i actually got most of them on there i was really getting ready to get Off the 5-day schedule and start looking at longer stuff. but then the popularity kicked in on vine (but still not so much on yt because vine doesn't let you put links to anywhere!!), so i had to do more short ones, just when i was really ready to do longer ones. so i had to sort of bend over backwards to condense the 7 day vine production down to as quick as possible to have enough time to try some long stuff, and after 3 months i finally finished one which actually did very well, and within a couple weeks i was doing better outside of vine than on vine. so by that point, not only have i made 200 more short videos than i ever really intended to, now i have a whole new audience which actually gets mad at me for doing short videos. so that's 2 reasons it's time to shift. don't get me wrong, i will still do things of all lengths and types. the original reason i did short things is because i like to do things of all different lengths, and i always wrote things of all different lengths, but the short ones are the quickest to produce, so i always fell into the trap of producing the short ones first, early on, because it is really the only way to get started."
do you really think a discord server is a good idea?,i have no idea. i really don't know what that is.

why would you prefer garageband over logic?,"garageband is crippled on purpose (to make you buy logic, i guess?) there are less shortcut keys, on purpose. this is torture. logic has as many shortcut keys as you want, which is a dream. logic is a dream, in many ways. However, one very important reason why garageband (or any simple program) would be an advantage, is there are less choices, so life is simpler. this phenomenon happens in any field. simpler tools can be limiting but also liberating. another reason you might prefer garage band over logic would be if you can't afford logic. which was the only reason i have ever used it."

To me, it didn't sound like the score was following any structure on it's own, so I thought it would be instead linked to the voice of the speaker. It sounds like the latter, but it doesn't sound like the voice to me. Is the music supposed to make the guy sing, or is it something else that I am missing?","i am not sure exactly what you mean, but i did not change the timing nor pitch of the recording. i just added music to it. the vocal was not influenced by the music, because it was recorded 47 years before the music. i composed and orchestrated the music to go along with the recording."

I always have great ideas, working mostly with guitar I'll have a cool riff or chord progression but don't know where t go from there. I've tried to learn music theory but it's in one ear and out the other most of the time.

You mentioned that after this video you'd like to have a weekly schedule of songs with videos like this or Japan mixed in. Did you have anything in mind for the first song or long video after this one or is this the sole focus currently?,"there are some ideas floating around for different types of videos. i will probably open the doors to some much different types. as far as songs, i will be working from the system as usual, and the main question will be whether to pick randomly or actually try to pick the 'right' one, which is an age old question that i never seem to fully answer. also singles vs groups of songs is another question that never seems to get permanently answered. those will be the main questions to start with. also, what's the schedule -- is it 2 weeks or 1 week, that will be another very important question. i want to have enough time to do a decent job but i also need it to be very very brisk (there are hundreds of songs to get through). also i need to do a 'notes' update (present and some past) and a 'reality' page update (present and past) and i need to set deadlines for those tasks as well, and do it before the song schedule starts."

"When you were working hard making 7 new Vines a week and then you started doing them even at a faster pace, do you have some regrets about it, do you feel some videos felt rushed or that quality suffered from the high production and output rate ?","actually no. being forced to work fast  is actually a huge blessing. creativity is so flexible, it is amazing the kind of decisions that you make when you have a deadline-- corners you cut, that you never would have dreamed of cutting if u had no deadline, but under pressure you make crazy decisions and your mind instantly gravitates toward the fast choices, and it also encourages you to gravitate toward more exciting choices to make up for the fact that you can't care delicately for every little thing. an example of one of my most intense time-crunches would be the babies-grownups-babies video. i took so many short cuts, and i was just throwing things in there so fast, and I was almost late for work (i am not telling you what my job is)but in the end, no one is complaining and look at all the stuff i have gotten done.given the demonic flexibility of the creative process, i am really feeling like i never want to work off-deadline again. i mean, I have been working off deadline on this current video for more than 4 months, and i THINK i'm going as fast as i can, but at the same time the video is much less than half done and i still have barely even gotten to the production. this is no way to live. i have a lot of stuff to do, songs, videos, so many things left to do and the years are going to fly by if i don't set some more insane deadlines. which is why i have recently set a deadline for the current video, which is completely unreasonable, and yet it is the best thing that has ever happened to me because it is making me get back into serious mad-crunch mode, which brings a much needed thrill to the never ending landscape of uncertainty of when this thing will ever be done."
do you ever miss how peaceful it was before the popularity of history of japan?,"before that video came out i was working my ass off to keep doing 7 new vines a week, due to their popularity. then out of desperation to make a long video, i started doing the vines even faster, to have time to work on a long video at the same time, and i continued on like that for 2 months, and then finally left vine behind in order to do a mad month-long push to get the japan video done, working day and night, while people kept asking why i had 'stopped' making videos.  which actually reminds me a lot of how things are going now."

(does that make sense?) I feel that way a lot when I'm making music - like I shouldn't care what people think and that I should just do what I know feels right, but then crippled when the things I make aren't liked OR affirmed when they are. you're in an interesting position because you claim not to give a shit (which I honestly believe is true) but people still love your work and tell you that all the time. you make whatever you want, but whatever you want wins awards.what should I do? how do I ignore them? or how do I balance these two contradictory parts of my brain?

If not, why not?","the whole thing started as a reading exercise, and originally it was usually just whole notes on the chords, and then the melody, sometimes even without drums or anything. but later on i started doing more like a 4 piece arrangement, and mostly now it goes percussion first, (then possibly another track of bigger drums, like kick/snare etc) then chords, then bass, then lead. i know you might think the bass should go before the chords, but nowadays i always do the bass after the chords, for some reason it works better that way. drums always first, but actually percussion before drums, which might seem backwards, but i discovered that percussion before drums actually works better for some reason."

Do you not see the traits and methods of execution that cause things to be similar enough to be considered in a genre?,"you can classify anything, in any way, for any reason. that's part of the fun. there are infinite categories, and you can make up the categories. and they are ever-changing. the lines will always blur, rightfully so. in fact it seems to me that it's hard to really do anything inspiring unless you are blurring someone's line, somewhere. genre naming is (and should be) way way too fluid and elastic for me to ever be able to feel comfortable with a question like 'what genre do you prefer.' to me, favorite-genre questions actually feel the same as 'what race of people do you prefer.' it just seems to crush the entire spirit of life when you look at it that way. i hope that makes sense."

Looking forward to it either way :)?","i have set a deadline. the deadline is completely ridiculous, and probably impossible, and i will certainly miss it, but i think it will still cause the remaining work to go twice as fast. the deadline you mentioned would be slightly more possible. the deadline i have set is quite a bit sooner, which i think is a healthy thing, although it is technically impossible."

I just watched a TV show and the pocket on her shirt switched sides in the 1st scene so I couldn't watch anymore.,"i wonder why that would happen... i would be curious to look at the scene. do you think it was a wardrobe switch, or a mirror image situation? one thing that really ruins things for me is edits within a conversation, which are supposed to be unnoticeable but they are noticeable. particularly when the person talking is facing away from the camera, but you can tell by the way their head is moving that it does not match. conversational edits often undermine the flow of the chemistry between the actors, and i frequently notice it."

"When you say you've edited parts of the video, are you editing the script first before moving on, or are you working on the video and saying this portion of the script should be trimmed?","i'm on 'phase 2' or the 'plan' stage, or 'pre-graphics', i am not sure what to call it. a lot of the graphic work actually gets done during this stage, it's basically like figuring out how the hell i am actually going to display on the screen what i just said in the script, and it actually inolves doing a lot more research, like nailing down exact geography specifics so i can show them on the map, or finding the images of people, etc etc. Like if i said and then the clowns took over ... a picture is worth a thousand words, so that may be fine for the script, but in order to show it on screen i have to know which clowns, i have to know what they were supposed to look like, i have to know exactly where they took over, so that often involves doing more research. or if i say 'then cheese wiz was invented' ... which cheese wiz was the first cheeze wiz? i can't just show modern cheese wiz and pass that off for the first kind. and a lot of times during this stage i may realize that a certain line in the script actually won't work, either because i realize it is innacurate, or maybe just doesn't seem good enough. so little revisions happen during this stage. also as i mentioned, the first draft was way longer than i wanted it to be, so when i do the re-writes i am always trying to say stuff quicker, and so far it is going great. every adjustment i have made has made it stronger and shorter at the same time. the shortening rate is averaging 18%, and i am at about the halfway point of the video."
"i think the 20 millino views question was poking fun at how you only work on the new video, not indirectly asking if you are working at all?","i think many people think that because they can't see the video, i am not doing it. i get an even mix of people who think i work too hard and think i am not working at all. it's enough to make you want to jump out of an elevator."

How do you explain dark energy?,"honestly, it is something the scientists really haven't figured out yet. and i think 'dark energy' is a pretty lame name for it, and it is pretty obvious from that name that we don't really know what it is. but it is directly connected to gravity, which we also really don't understand. the entire world wants to fly apart (because of 'dark energy'), and everything in it wants to fly together (because of 'gravity'). and i guess no one can exactly explain why this is happening, but the way i see it if these 2 things weren't happening we wouldn't have a universe. so."
How many minutes is the video down to now?,"as of half way through, i have trimmed by 2min21sec. i am currently at what used to be the 12:36 mark, which is now at 10:15. that means if nothing else is trimmed, the total time is down to at least 19:34. but if i am able to continue at this trim rate (about 18%) the total length will be down to about 17:50 by the end. but i think it would still be nice to beat 15min."

"In your song New Canaan, you say that you're going to New Canaan, Pennsylvania, then later rectify that the town is actually in Connecticut (which is true). However, you go on to refer to it as New Canaan, Pennsylvania many times after that. Why?","not many times, only once. and there are multiple reasons why. the first reason would be the same reason that it is said that way in the first line of the song -- it is just better melodically. the second reason is because given that it already is that way at the beginning of the verse, the verse naturally wants to end the same as it started. and the 3rd reason it makes sense is that by immediately returning to false details after having explained the real truth, we have now firmly established the recurring theme of incorrect details, which is further developed later. i think if you try singing 'connecticut' in either of the first 2 locations where it's 'pennsylvania' i think you will find that it is not only extremely awkward, but also undermines one of the main concepts of the song."

what progress have you made on the video today?,"today had some very intense setbacks and yet very intense progress. lately as i've shifted into the beginning stages of production (from writing) the looming magnitude of this project has intensified even more, which is hard to even imagine considering it was already unimaginably intense (the research and writing actually took 12 weeks.) there are endless new challenges, and i saw some particularly technical ones today, relating to processing power, etc. i will need to make small comprimises across the board in order to do anything at a respectable pace. that's about all i can say without going into detail. on the other hand, i had some victories content wise, regarding re-writes and trims. at what is now 5:56, this point was at 7:15 in the first draft. this is good news because i was concerned that the original 22 min draft not only had some tedious and tiresome parts, but it is also not reasonable to ever expect to finish the video if it is that long. getting into the swing of these re-writes, the prospect looks good for actually bringing this endlessly long thing down to a still-very-long but very swift and exciting adventure, and also be feasibly finishable by the end of the decade."
