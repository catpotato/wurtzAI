I've been trying to crack down on hand independence on the piano recently. What tips can you give to a semi-beginner to help with hand independence? Thanks <3?,"i'm not sure. i just kind of do what i need to do. There are a few different worlds of playing piano -- one where you play bass with your left hand, chords with your right hand, and sing the melody. there is another world (like if you are in a band) where the bass player plays the bass, and a singer or horn player plays the melody, and just play chords with whatever hand you want. then there is another world like a jazz trio where the bass player plays the bass and you play chords with your left hand and melody with your right hand. and there is another world where you are by yourself and not singing, so you have somehow play all 3 with 2 hands. depending on which world you are in, you would practice different things."

"in the abc song, the qrs part sounds so... fulfilling. How did you make it sound the way it do?","that would depend which verse. the instrumentation would be slightly different in each verse. that line has the same melody as the 3 lines before it. my only guess would be vocal harmonies. the vocal harmonies gradually increase throughout the song, and i think in the case of the first and second verses, qrs probably gets more because it's the 3rd line. that's my best explaination. if you tell me specifically which verse i can analyze it further."

What is the best way to write lyrics? I'm always struggling with that. It's hard to find rhymes that make sense and mine always sound so cheesy?,"NEVER CHASE THE RHYME. there is nothing worse than a contrived rhyme. Also, when you chase rhymes, that implies that all your lines will be in sets of 2 that are all the same length. that's just not the way it has to work. Really just open your mind up and take it moment by moment. ask yourself what could you do at each moment that would excite You? you would be surprised how often rhymes show up automatically. but another important thing to remember about rhymes in music, --- it really doesn't matter if the consonants rhyme. it really just matters if the vowel rhymes. in music, fine and time rhyme. no one will ever complain about that. i like to stretch it even more, and sometimes it is actually enjoyable when you break the rhyme. but i will say this again, ...... do not chase the rhyme. the rhymes will always come to you if the time is right. also i should probably mention that i only write lyrics together with the melody. if you are writing only lyrics without a melody, i can understand why you might think you need to search for rhymes. but if put it to a melody, what you will find that the rhymes will want to be in all different places, and the rhymes that you had on paper pre-melody will no longer work. Really what i'm trying to say is, there is absolutely no rules, remain open, and have fun. and never chase rhymes, you will find them coming to you when the time is right."

what inspired you to create the video time mop?,"that was actually an old instrumental, from 2009 (there were actually 4 in a row). recorded them very spontaneously, making bold /brash moves. an effort to shock myself out of non-recording (i had already started to write, but i still hadn't recorded any of it.) the video wasn't until 2014. i was doing music videos (from previously recorded songs... usually ones with lyrics) twice a week. but it's a whole different game when you make a video based on an existing instrumental recording. there's no lyrics or content, or plot points, or anything! what the hell do you put in the video? it was a fun challenge to see what happens in the video. the other main example is the video for 'no castle', also instrumental, where again the track is much older than the video, and it is an experiment to see if you can find things out of nowhere to put in the video, to match the music."

how did you got inspired for making the song and vid of new canaan? i really love it?,"was in penn station one time and i was just like 'damn, there's trains here that go to the entire world, i just pick somewhere and see what's there. even if it's nothing, i don't care, i want to go.'  so 4 different times that month (may 2009) i took a songbook and went to a random place, and wrote a song on the way. new canaan got some very very small edits (mainly in the last verse) in 2012. got recorded in 2014 on the wednesday song schedule. then it came up for a tuesday music video a few months later, and being almost 3 minutes, it was extremely ambitious to fit in to the schedule... basically means i had to do the video in about 1 day, which is why it is Extremely low budget...  just did like 1 full length vocal take, 1 drum take, maybe did a couple specific bass fills.... and there's hardly any graphics... the occasional train or map just barely makes it interesting enough.ultimately i'm glad it got recorded, it was very high on my most-wanted list (mainly because of that license plate line, honestly) for many years."

However you want to look at it. basically just trying to hype up the current generation that we might be able to get it! and make everything great using all our combined knowledge and spirit, etc. It was written in 2009, but probably could have been written at any time, with the names of all the decades and years changed."

"I'm not really that good at writing music but I like to make it anyway. I've been using GarageBand for instrumentals and Notes for lyrics. I don't think it'll amount to anything and I sometimes wonder if I took music theory classes, which I don't want to take, whether I would get better and whether it would be worth it. Basically what it boils down to is do I want to waste my time doing something that will help in the long run but that I really don't want to do and that I don't need or do I want to teach myself and get better agonizingly slowly but have a lot more fun doing it?","news flash.... the fact that you don't want to learn music theory is a sneak preview that you are not going to learn it if you expect someone else to teach it to you. that's just the nature of music theory and/or ... the nature of learning in general, i think! you can't just go to the doctor and get a 'shot' of 'music theory' and know it. besides ..... it doesn't really exist!! the way music theory (if there is such a thing) works is .... it's really just how you choose to make sense of the musical world you live in.  Every music theory class really is just an extrapolation of what seems to be the principles among a CERTAIN SET of music that was popular during a certain time period.  If you go to a classical school, they will teach you things that relate to what was popular in europe several centuries ago. if you go to berklee, they will probably teach you a lot about what was popular in the 1940s. there could be a class based on only the last 20 years of music, and it would be different still. there is really only a small amount of stuff that is really actually established and unchanging. like note names -- europe named the notes with letters a few centuries ago, and it really stuck. the entire world uses those notes. do you know them? (A, Bb, B, C, etc)."

You often mention feelings of loneliness, and I wonder if this is actually how you feel, or if it's part of the self-deprecating humour routine. It boggles me, because you seem absolutely content with being alone, and I know that personally, if I had the chance to meet you or even write together, I would grab it immediately.

I AM NOT JUST SAYING THIS. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. KEEP IT SIMPLE IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO START DOING THIS, and if you don't keep it simple i don't think you have a chance of succeeding. nothing ever worked for me until i started simple. start with like whatever is built into your computer, and if you don't have a computer maybe i can give you some suggestions. start ... simple .... use mario paint if that's all you have. you'd probably get projects done quicker than me."
