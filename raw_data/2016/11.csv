Most songs use 4 beats per bar. some songs use 3 (or even other numbers in rare cases) but usually 4. See if you can find the beats and bars in some of your favorite songs. then the next step is to get some staff paper and i will tell you how rhythms work. actually you can do rhythms without staff paper but if you want to learn to read you are going to eventually have to get staff paper. ok let me know when you are ready for the next step."

how do you feel about pirating music? Not yours but in general?,"copies are not really worth anything. anyone can make a copy of a file on a computer, and share it with a friend. this is free. the only copy of a song that you can really charge for is the original, because if the artist doesn't release the original, then no one will ever hear it. so the original really has the highest value, and the creator can charge any price for it, and if that price is not paid then the song will never be released. but once it is released, it would be hard to sell copies, because anyone can make a copy for free. so any company that is trying to sell you copies of a song (basically any copy after the original) really cannot expect to make money. unless they have some kind of police force to stop people from sharing files with their friends."

how come you've got blind(to no avail) on both church sessions and murder your demon? to communicate different vibes or what?,"church sessions' was all the songs recorded in aug 2010. 'murder your demon' was an attempt to put all the ones Written in aug 2010 together, which included 2 extra ones recorded later (early 2011). but there was another one that should have been on there (free to) which actually never got recorded until 2015. i wish i could albumize songs according to the writing, but as you can see that's almost impossible. there are still probably songs from the 'demon' writing sessions that are not yet recorded. then in 2012-13 i spent several months updating and finishing the writing on many songs, which further obfuscates the original writing dat."
Now when you write a song do you go fuck because you know you're gonna have to record that after all the other old songs you haven't recorded yet.

"how do i make my basslines more interesting in parts where the chords stay the same a for a while? i'm just alternating between the root, the 5th, and the octave but it sounds boring. what else can i do to make it more interesting?","if the chords are not moving, then your new boss is the melody/lyric. do in the bass whatever it takes to make the melody/lyric feel the best. try many different things. you never know what it will be."
"if you've just finished recording an old song, do you date it with the year it was originally written or with the current year?","the date it is recorded. and there is another layer too, because sometimes i do a video at an even later time, in which case the video would be dated to when the video is made. there are some examples of when the writing, audio, and video were done at 3 vastly different times."

Like the ones you use to get music on spotify/itunes/whatever. i've been looking at Tunecore for myself starting out, did you have any experience with them or someone else? Thanks?","i think it's insane that i have to pay someone to press upload for me. i had a mental breakdown over this during 2015. i have moved past it. i am now paying 2 different services to press upload because one of them doesn't allow songs less than a minute but will do next day delivery and the other one will allow songs of any length but it takes 4 weeks for the song to appear on the site. also the stores don't let anyone create their own artist image. you have to submit it to Rovi, who basically doesn't even accept them if you are not important enough."

It'd mean basically nothing to any of us, and it'd make a world of difference to you. It may feel like you're selling out, but you can still use the money to buy new gear for videos.",

how hard are you working on the new video compared to History Of Japan (an example of an answer would be twice as much)?,over all it is the same. in both cases i am working as fast as i can.
I edited a version of your history of japan video to take out the swearing - is it okay if i upload it to youtube? Much love :)?,"please do not do that. but also please don't ask me how i feel about other people who do that. it is not good, so i try my best to ignore it. also please don't ask why i don't want to be asked about it, because that forces me to worry about it too."

How do you know when you need to add something new to the FAQ.,"the FAQ is an unlinked page. i used to occasionally link people to it when they ask about it, but that also involves updating it (adding every question to the page since the last time i linked it, and also maybe deleting the obsolete ones). this is really not a good use of my time so i have not updated it in a while."

"So with the Dec. 1 deadline, would you say your progress (both for the video and compared to the Japan video) is increasing exponentially?","it increased a lot after oct 15, which is when i established the dec1 deadline, but since then i have pretty much maxed out. i am still setting timers and making minute by minute goals which are attempting to push it tigher, 1min20 seconds (on graphics) per day is about the most i think is possible, that's my grand record, on a full day. but i am still trying to beat that. in order to meet dec1, i pretty much have to be done with the graphics by this thursday (which would entail doing about 4min per day at this point) and even if i did that, i would still have to absolutely crush the rest, at unprecedented levels. still have to record the final narration, and final vocals for all jingles (which mostly has dense 4 part harmonies, as you know. and there's 66 jingles) and do the score, which probably takes the longest out of those 3 things. very important, i wish i could let you hear what history of japan sounded like with only narration and jingles and no underscored music (it is very boring, the underscore has huge effect on the video, that's why i underscore all my own music, moment by moment). Everything after graphics (score, jingles, narration, labels, troubleshoot, etc etc) for history of japan took a total of 30 days. so even if i finish graphics by thursday (wildly impossible) i would have to complete what was 30 days (for a 9 min vid) in 13 days (for a 19 min vid.) so basically that would require more than a 4x speed improvement from what i was doing in dec/jan last year on japan. but, graphics so far has generally been running at 2x speed from last year. i don't know how that's possible. maybe because i'm not trying to make vines every day? not really sure how to account for it, but i guess i have more experience now."

"do you find it hard to take the dec 1st deadline seriously sometimes, since you are aware that it is slightly impossible?","i thought it would be, i have never used a deadline for a long project, i did not set one for history of japan until the final 2 weeks. but then i figured just because i have never tried it doesn't mean i shouldn't try it, because i needed to do something. this could have been a year long project, and there is no time for that. so i tried it, and so far it has worked miraculously well - i think i set just the right date - something that 'seems' possible. and regardless, it has seriously made things go faster."

"What are you gonna do if you get to Dec 1st and the video isn't done? Will you set a new, even more ridiculous deadline?","setting a more ridiculous deadline would be hard, because it would have to be in the past at that point. but i will re negotiate, and play it just as tight. the great news is, having this deadline in effect (which it has been since about mid october) has probably reduced the *actual* production time by as much as 2 months. i mean, in october i was potentially looking at what could have been a years worth of work, if i tried to do a slow, careful, thoughtful job. but after setting the dec 1 deadline and slamming through the past 4 weeks on insano mode, it is now almost guaranteed that it will be done by jan 1, but only if i keep taking dec 1 seriously. i am still taking it seriously. aiming to have the graphics done by this thursday, which would mean i have to double my speed from last week, which was already doubled from the speed i was working on the history of japan graphics."

"at the rate you're going right now, when do you think the new video will be released? take your time on it?","i am still pretending this deadline is real. the deadline is dec 1. just to be clear, this is physically impossible, and it has been since i set the date. but i am still taking it very seriously, and it has caused huge miracles to happen, and caused me to race to insane superspeeds."

"How far along on the video are you today, or what phase/step are you on? and is it alright to ask? I ask out of excitement and support but I worry it comes across as impatience or rudeness?","at 5:30, on graphics. making insanely good progress. the graphics stage for history of japan took 30 days, and the best day i ever had last year was 30 seconds in a day, that was like the maximum (and i was working solidly all day every day). the past few days has been 47, 1:20, 58, 50. so i am crushing my rates from last year, which is good news because this vid is twice as long. it's all thanks to the imaginary deadline i am using (still technically impossible.) also the video is coming out wild."
How did you get into making videos?,
do you feel calm at this particular moment?,yes.
do u ever say 'yep'?,yes.
If the video is not finished by your deadline will you continue to work on it?,"of course. the deadline was deliberately set to be way sooner than reasonable, and it has always been technically impossible. but the crazy thing is, it has gotten way more possible since i have set it. having that deadline has caused serious miracles to happen. setting time clocks constantly for the entire day, tracking my progress, pushing every minute of every day to the absolute max. and i think it actually makes the video better, because it forces you to make stronger decisions to cope with less time doing tedious nitpicking. the deadline still remains impossible, but i continue to take it seriously, because it is actually becoming more possible. it is so revitalizing to work like this, i think i am never going to work off-deadline again, on anything."
