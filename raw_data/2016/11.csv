Not yours but in general?,"copies are not really worth anything. anyone can make a copy of a file on a computer, and share it with a friend. this is free. the only copy of a song that you can really charge for is the original, because if the artist doesn't release the original, then no one will ever hear it. so the original really has the highest value, and the creator can charge any price for it, and if that price is not paid then the song will never be released. but once it is released, it would be hard to sell copies, because anyone can make a copy for free. so any company that is trying to sell you copies of a song (basically any copy after the original) really cannot expect to make money. unless they have some kind of police force to stop people from sharing files with their friends."
