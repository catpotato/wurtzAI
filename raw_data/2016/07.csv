"When's your next video? Also, you should make longer videos xd?","i'm doing it now, that's what's taking so long."
Why does the title of the thabk you say thank you?,

do you talk to yourself?,
How do I get started on music?Specifically the piano.,
Do u even lift??,
can you make a compilation page of all the answers you responded who is this?,the majority of them are do you love me and do you miss me.
when are u coming back?,where.
"Why do you think rock music dropped the tambourine? I always thought it added a lot to songs, so it's a shame it seems to be neglected.","i use it, you use it, many people use it. i don't know exactly who you are referring to when you say 'rock music' but the tambourine is alive and well."

did the toaster do it?,do what.
is this world the best of all possible worlds?,no.
"When you write songs, do you start with the lyrics or the music first?",always both at the same time. neither one makes sense without the other.
"In your 'end of the world concert' song, do you know that song as 'On the Floor' or as 'Lambada'?","it was inspired by the j-lo version (actually only the epic spiritual instrumental riff part of the song, not the generic saturday night drunk america part). i do realize that the melody is based on an ancient traditional song that has gone around the block numerous times throughout the ages, and i have heard those as well. but at the time i was playing the 2011, as is evident in the chords. this caused a bit of a mental dilema when posting it to the site, because i wanted to link the 'info' button to the most authentic and original version of the song, but the bottom line is, the chords for the original version are different. i was playing the chords for the j-lo version. so that is why i chose to link the info to the j-lo version. but really what i was referencing was only the riff portion of the j-lo version."
I noticed your songs page doesn't have every single jingle in MP3 format. Do the missing ones only exist as videos?,"it has always been confusing to draw the line for what to include on that page. it used to include only things that were written first as songs. then as there were more and more 'musical' vines, i felt it was unfair to not include some of those. so i ended up adding many of the musical vines, but still not including ones that rely on the video (how am i gonna include a how to fly a plane jingle, outside the context of explaining the answer?) as it is, it feels like there are way way too many short bits on the songs page, and that is compounded by the fact that i recorded a way too high percentage of short songs even before i started doing videos. this balance will hopefully finally be corrected soon when i start recording songs weekly or bi-weekly (WITHOUT also trying to do short vids every day like in 2014)."
you said i really wanna do a band and have expressed interest in playing live and possibly touring. can you explain why you want to? or how it would be more fun or fulfilling than what you are doing now?,"wow, isn't it obvious? usually the questions go the other way around, and i usually have to defend the fact that i do everything myself. live playing in a band is where the real musical paradise is, i just always felt unlucky enough that i grew up in a sort of social isolation, and combined with personality factors, just ended up alone and never able to find the right people. i always figured the light at the end of the tunnel would be eventually having enough influence and/or money that i could do have a medium/large band to actually direct, and afford to pay great people and really do it right."
what is the best possible question i could ask you?,
Do what you hate and make a ton of money? or do what you like and make nothing?,no thanks.

i can see how some of the corrections you made to the japan video are necessary but the typhoon distinction and rape acknowledgment take away from the video in my opinion. is it worth appeasing the top comment complainers if it takes away from your vids?,is it worth appeasing those who complain about the corrections if it takes away from the corrections?
If I gave you a chord out of context could you explain how you would use it in a song? How about... C/Bb?,"the most common place i would see that is in F, usually as part of the 'you are everything and everything is you' sequence. or 'gotta make the song cry' etc etc."

how did you become so wise?,i dropped myself on my head when i was young.
"Have you ever realised you made a mistake, but you were too far into it that you couldn't just pull out, you had to see the mistake to its inevitable conclusion?","i think so. i have done enough things that i am sure that has happened, but usually i don't consider it a mistake. like making the reality section of this website, toward the end i was like holy smokes, this took a long time, and it has delayed everything else and even now, i continue to get lectures for why i am not done with the 'next history video' and probably the main reason is because i spent 3 months making the reality pages, and sometimes i think 'holy smokes' what if i didn't do all that. but it still wasn't a mistake, i had to do it and i am glad i did it then instead of later."

"It is in my opinion at least that sex is crucial to art. specifically music because you can parallel the strategys and end-goals in both and they are the same. working with something(or someone) you love to attain an unexplainable euphoria.

Are you an intp?,"the mbti result is not who you are, it's just based on how you answered the questions."
"I know you're constantly asked about The History of Japan video and continuing it as a series. I'm curious why the subject almost seems irksome to you. It seems like a chore. I see that you're working on some manner of a sequel but even having read hundreds of your questions and answers here I can't seem to figure out why you would spend all of that time making that video, and then when you strike gold (because it's hilarious, educational, and original) it takes 5 months to not even be done writing the next one. I don't mean to come off as entitled, I just sincerely wonder what the trepidation is about.",if working my ass off as fast as i can every single day is called trepidation i suppose i need to look up that word because i thought it meant something different.
"Why do the key changes at the prechoruses of we could just get high not follow a pattern? (D to A, D to C#, G# to Bb)?","why would they follow a pattern? the human listener notices how it feels, not how it looks when you analyze it on paper. it's kind of like how stories have twists and turns and surprises. Actually, i was stumped on this song for months -- i had verse 1, cho, verse 2, and just was losing momentum in the second chorus --- that was before i had the idea for the second key change. then all of a sudden it occured to me to put the second chorus in a much different key, and that really sparked the right feeling at that point in the song. The first chorus already sort of had that effect (raised a whole step), and it was a natural continuation of the 'liberating/escape' feeling to have the second chorus be unexpectedly even more adventurous. From that point on, it was just a delicate balance of where i thought it should go next, and i just listened carefully to where it wanted to go from there, and the song was finished very quickly."

Do you sometimes hate yourself?,no.
Do you profit from your content?,"not from videos. only from donations, and music sales."

"so, if you'll allow me to be the advocate of some non-corporeal thing other than the devil. it is intuitive to you that everyone else would want to have the same unending desire to create that you do. so, in the world of all bill wurtzes, are you all in churches somewhere making history videos? or do you occasionally check in on each other and see if you can say the same thing at the same time without planning ahead?",i'm not sure i understand the question. but i will say the main thing i do is not to make history videos.
what do you think about asmr?,seems legit.
"When writing a song, do you always write out the chart first before you record? or have you recorded songs without having written out a chart beforehand?","i have found that it has to be firmly written before recording, or the recording falls apart. but since 2011 i don't really do it on paper from start to finish, it is more of an ongoing brainstorming session."
Do you read books often? Do you have any favorites?,"we live in a time when the written word has become more common via computers than on physical pages. in that light, i don't know exactly how to determine which of those writings should be considered a book and what should not."
you must dislike the concept of auto-correct?,"well, typing on a smartphone is impossible, so i need it for spelling. but the capitalization kills me. try typing roman catholic church without capitalizing anything. you have to keep un-capitalizing (3 times)."

bill why are you answering questions at like 5 AM?,
"Do you feel like as soon as you finish writing this new video, recording it will be a breeze because you don't have to hesitate about what you're going to do?","i'm not sure. i can see the reasons why writing for this one is so much more intense (because it is a much broader topic, and much more of a puzzle, and much more research for even just the tiniest lines). and it is true that those challenges will certainly not apply to the scoring phase, or narration recording, or any of the music. there will surely be many specifics to iron out in the graphics, i should mention that there is an entire phase that goes between writing and graphics which also involves a heavy amount of research just to clarify and verify the details and data that i am saying. so that part will probably be just as intense. another totally separate factor is the new graphics tricks that i will inevitably have to learn in order to illustrate some of the things in this video."
why i can't get chinese takeaway from mcdonald?,you will have to ask them.
does the set of all sets that do not contain themselves contain itself?,you might have just discovered the origin of time.

"so, making all the assorted stuff that you talk about needing to make seems like the thing that you would do with an infinite supply of food, water, internet, etc. what do you think about the fact that it isn't like that for most people? also, is that purpose contingent on other people regularly consuming the assorted stuff?","i don't know why it's not like that for most people, but that's none of my business. and yes i do rely on people consuming the content, but i have always been confident that that would happen eventually, as long as i keep steadily making it. after 2015 this became a reality."
"alphabet shuffle has been stuck in my head all day and made a really crappy day at work into one that was really positive. i was able to proactively solve problems, instead of focusing on how much it sucks to have that problem.  what do you do to make your mentality positive instead of negative?","work in a step by step manner, drink enough water, etc."

"what are advantages to playing 5-string bass  instead of a 4-string bass, and should i throw my 5-string bass away? or sell it?","the advantages are the low notes between B and E. you can certainly live without B, but if you really have to live without that Eb, you could find yourself in some sad situations. however, if you are clever, you can learn to survive just fine. after all, everyone got along just fine until the 1980s. personally, i use at least down to Db quite frequently. In modern times, i have found that many players use an octave doubler (with a 4 string) when they need those notes. however, some players choose to use the octave doubler irresponsibly, and they go way below B, resulting in a rumbly mess, and also being punched in the face by me."
"What does being yourself really mean, though? It's incredibly vague (that's a serious question). I love the ideology but wouldn't know the first thing about implementing it. There are no bounds to being myself except the physical body I live in, which does not dictate my mind. What is there about being myself that I don't get?",nothing. you are already yourself. it can be whatever you want.
i'm torn between being the version of me that's more true to myself and being a version of me that's attractive to prospective partners because loneliness is a driving force in my life. what should i do?,"be yourself. being a fake version of yourself will cause devastating damage to a relationship, and it will also make you unattractive to people who are actually right for you."

is the reason why there isn't much of the harmonizing videos(to like paul mccartney) because it's hard to do or because you don't want to give away your influences?,"who says those videos have to feature my 'influences'? the other one was a random weather report from the 1980s. sometimes i wish i could just do speech harmonization for the rest of my life. it is a very rewarding and interesting task. it is one of those things that i could see myself being totally happy doing only just that. the only problem is that there is a lot more stuff i want to do, and also the speech harmonization thing is really only accessible to a very small audience of mostly musicians."
"Since making the 'History of Japan' video, nonetheless having it go viral, do you feel you have set a standard for what your 'big projects' should gravitate towards? (IMHO: I worry for your creative freedom, Mr. Wurtz. I want you to be able to publish content you feel expresses your views and ideologies through the art form you feel most comfortable in.)?","i will be doing a wide range of things. the next video will hopefully be within the same realm as history of japan, while also expanding widely beyond it. also i will be doing weekly song releases after the video is done."

"what is your opinion on composing music using ways? e.g. the passacaglia format where you have a 4-8ish measure bass sequence that repeats for the whole thing. a somewhat popular and recent example is c418's sweden from the minecraft soundtrack. to me, with this sort of thing, there's two potential appeals: shock value (omg! a passacaglia) and innovation (using an arbitraryish restriction can improve both your own thing and the restriction) but both of these can easily work against you.there has been at least one time where i have lied.","i have tried using loop based writing, based on the fact that looped stuff has been used so heavily in the last ... 30 years. but ultimately i realized that given my particular strengths, it is best to not confine myself to loops, but rather to just write what i want to write when i want to write it."

i'm trying to transcribe a song but i can't make out the voicing of the last chord. do you have any ideas? https://clyp.it/qlx11xk1?,"well, the first instinct is that it's a standard 5 chord from Fmin, with all the dirty notes -- mainly including the 'dirtiest' note, Gb. so the melody is on top (c, 2 oct above middle C) then right under it you have Ab in the piano, then E under that, and down in the lower octave you have Gb, and then Db (next to middle C). by 'law' it feels like Bb has to be in this chord, and I am almost certain it is. usually Bb likes to go next to middle C, in that range, for these chords. certainly it is C7, b9, b13, b5 (oh also, no one would be playing a G note, i can guarantee that, there is no room for that, they are already playing all the other notes, plus we just came from a G rooted chord). so that is my best assessment. the note that makes this chord sound extra dirty is the Gb. all the other notes are completely standard for c7 in f minor."

"i have a specific question, i hope you don't mind answering it. in your world what is your name for this particular chord voicing? starting on D just below middle C and going upD F# G D E? commonly played on guitar.Dadd4add9? D4add9? D24? wtf?","well, it's kind of like you have red and blue at the same time. what you call it depends on what's around it. like if the entire canvas is red, and then some parts of it had blue also, you would call those parts the 'blue parts' and not mention the red. but if the entire canvas was blue and red, then you would call all the parts blue and red. what i'm trying to say is, that chord is full blown D and Dsus2/4 at the same time. but from a song perspective, it is likely that you may alternate that chord with just regular D. if that is the case, like in the all red (and some blue) painting, you would call it D2/4, because that's the part that has D2/4, and the regular D part doesn't. but if you were playing only entirely that chord (with the 2 and 4 and 1 and 3 together) for the whole time, then you might as well say D add this add that add everything including the kitchen sink. Also the reader will have more time to read it if it's the only chord on a page. but if it is in a song where regular D chords are also used, then i would def. just say D2/4 and it's players choice if u wanna open it all up like that."

"You said in a previous answer that you used to write down all your music and only learned to use voice memos/improvised riffs in 2011. I can only write music the second way, and I find it very, very difficult to write music notation-first. Did you learn to write music that way in music school, or is that your natural composing style? Do you think it's worth it for me to force myself to write music on paper before touching the keyboard/guitar as a learning experience?","do whatever works. for a long time i was unable to do it the 'memo' way ... because how do you figure out which part to start with? how do you figure out when something is final? all kinds of questions, my mind would fall apart. so eventually i just said, 'well, i have to start somewhere' and i figured i was literate enough to just hit the page and start writing. but this results in a very strange kind of writing (think modern woes or rabbit snakes) where you start with some completely random garbage, and then that part is final. and you have to move on to the next part. so you get this disjointed thing-after-thing format, almost never obeying any repeating form."
"Do you think you'll ever significantly update your musical workflow? If so, what are you looking forward to? Virtual instruments? Kurzweil synths? A banjo?","it will probably take a major global political upheaval to get me off the midi-only method. that being said, i would love to get my hands on some new sounds, HOWEVER i need to always find ways to keep it really simple, because i just collapse if there are too many choices. sometimes i feel like it was easier when i used garageband because there were fewer possibilities."

how did the video and the song hi it's 1995 came out what was the inspiration for that video?,"was written sometime in 2013, i was mostly doing revises and edits for existing songs, i don't know why the 1995 one came to me out of nowhere. being short, it reached 100% completion automatically, so it ended up in the 'completed songs' list which formed itself and then was arranged in order of time length, during 2013. and i started recording shortest-first, so naturally 1995 was one of the first ones. also, during 2013 i was trying to get started doing videos for them, which i was ALSO starting with shortest first. 1995 was sort of a stray, i was almost giving up on shortest first, and i had just finished building the website, and this was right before i spontaneously started the 5-day schedule. the concept for the video seemed straight forward. so i brainstormed a list of all the items - there were probably about 20-25 relevant items i came up with and found images for. and then i spent some time figuring out which ones to put where in the 5x3 grid. interestingly enough, a year later when i edited it for vine, i had room for one more item (vines are square, so it became a 4x4 grid, 16 items instead of 15.) so there is actually 1 additional item that got added to the vine edit."

If the Japan video took about 3 and a half months can we expect similar content to be spaced out by at least this kinda time-interval?,"there is a huge range of different types of content that is desperately important. one of them is research videos. if that were the only thing, then that would be all i would do. however, another thing that is equally important to me is recording as many of the 100s of songs i've written as possible, as well as going on many new songwriting adventures. there are other things i am intensely interested in doing also, but songs and research videos are probably at the top right now. that being said, the current research video i am working on will be at least 25% longer than history of japan, and probably 10 times as dense, research wise."

"Dear Sir:I have been requested by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company to contact you for assistance in resolving a matter. The Nigerian National Petroleum Company has recently concluded a large number of contracts for oil exploration in the sub-Sahara region. The contracts have immediately produced moneys equaling US$40,000,000. The Nigerian National Petroleum Company is desirous of oil exploration in other parts of the world, however, because of certain regulations of the Nigerian Government, it is unable to move these funds to another region.You assistance is requested as a non-Nigerian citizen to assist the Nigerian National Petroleum Company, and also the Central Bank of Nigeria, in moving these funds out of Nigeria. If the funds can be transferred to your name, in your United States account, then you can forward the funds as directed by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company. In exchange for your accommodating services, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company would agree to allow you to retain 10%, or US$4 million of this amount.However, to be a legitimate transferee of these moneys according to Nigerian law, you must presently be a depositor of at least US$100,000 in a Nigerian bank which is regulated by the Central Bank of Nigeria.If it will be possible for you to assist us, we would be most grateful. We suggest that you meet with us in person in Lagos, and that during your visit I introduce you to the representatives of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company, as well as with certain officials of the Central Bank of Nigeria.Please call me at your earliest convenience at 18-467-4975. Time is of the essence in this matter; very quickly the Nigerian Government will realize that the Central Bank is maintaining this amount on deposit, and attempt to levy certain depository taxes on it.Yours truly,Prince Alyusi Islassis?","that's a better one than i have been using. i was using the cousin one, this one i think will work better. thank you."

And if not have youtubers like CGP Grey influenced the direction you wish to continue the history videos?","i think the cgpgrey on acid description might have come from me, i think someone asked me what to expect in the upcoming video, and that was the best approximation i could give. now that the video is out, i wouldn't need to describe it like that, i would instead just describe it like."
why do my questions not show up for me?,they don't show up unless i answer them.
"What was your favorite part about making the history of Japan video? Apart from the fan reception, if that's numero uno.","it might be making the score. (not the jingles, but the rest of the music). the score was the last layer. even after i had completed all the graphics, and had the final narration in place, (and the jingles) but still no score, i remember watching it and it was exciting, but there was still a possible element of doubt as to whether or not this video would really fly. but when i started doing the score, that's when it started to come alive. in fact, as soon as i had the boom/low-tone/flashy news-desk part that goes underneath 'year negative a billion', just seeing it up until there with the music, that's when i knew this is gonna be fun. in fact, it was right when i started on the score that i finally abandoned daily vines, because i realized how important it was to finish this."
what was the inspiration behind tfw when you'r when when when tfw #2015 affff?,mainly it was about how every vine in the universe seemed to start with the word when. then i combined it with a few other popular devices that i felt were hardcore trending of the day.

"is it very important to work straight from beginning to end on the new video, or would you consider taking one week to work on a song and music video to release before the long video is done?","well i was doing that for a little bit, but i got such harsh lectures for not doing a history video sayind stuff like bill, why aren't you doing a history video and bill, you fucking idiot, why aren't you doing a history video. which makes me so angry because i AM doing a history video. there are 2 things i want to do desperately, and that's songs and research videos. I'm not sure where people stand on this issue. i just can't take being accused of not doing something i AM doing, AND it is something i want to do. i want to do them both, so it is very difficult to see where to go here. in a way, i want to start doing songs every week, like NOW, but at the same time i gotta get this history video done. Even people who defend me say hey, he only wanted to make history of japan, that was a one-time deal. leave him alone. but it's NOT a one-time deal whatsoever. japan was just a test run of a much greater realm of the research format. So either way i am stuck. it's a lot like how i felt stuck between vine and history, before the history video came out, everyone thought i was an 'idiot' and 'irresponsible' for not following through on more vines. it's hard to figure out who is in the majority, and i don't think i should. i saw a content creator try to do a voting system for what the fans thought he should do, and i was honestly very turned off by the idea. i was thinking you're the dude, i'm following YOU, ... if you're the leader and you don't know where to go, that's not a very strong sign of leadership. so i generally try to stay away from trying to go strictly where the majority would say i should go. besides, if i did that, there's no way i would have taken the risk to do history of japan when i already had a vibrant vine following. so ultimately i have to do what i think is right, and i am extremely torn between songs and big videos at this juncture, but this particular video is turning out to be really large and epic and i think it is exactly what needs to happen right now. and it could easily take a few more months if i work SOLIDLY on it. who knows what may happen if i try to take detours and do songs.... that will make it take even longer, and imagine how much more intense the lectures will get."
You clearly don't value the opportunity you've opened up for yourself.  You could be making big money off your current videos and even bigger money if you made more History of videos.  Your popularity could be through the roof.  Why have you not capitalized off of the videos you have made and your YouTube channel in general?,"you clearly don't value the opportunity i've opened up for myself. you have mostly missed the point of it. also, off the subject, but i have been working on a brand new, bigger and better history video solidly for the last 27 days."
Me and my friend wrote a short film but have no idea how to execute it. We don't have a lot of money to hire actors and such and we can barely afford props but we need to succeed at this film. It is the one thing I'm good at and I can't fail. I am very proud of the script and would really really enjoy doing this.,"you are going to have to comprimise. really stretch the limits of what you can act out yourself. then, of all the elements that you feel you can't provide yourself, narrow it down to like the most important thing that's missing, and then stretch your available contacts to the limit to find *something* or *someone*. make little comprimises here and there, from re-writes to re-casting, comprimise a little bit everywhere and you will get it done. filmmaking is insane, it requires a small country to do it right but there's only one path to get there and it's comprimise. even the big league films make comprimises (for example the viewer is not actually in the film)."
do you get annoyed when people ask the same questions and you have to link them to the original answers?,"absolutely not. it is a soothing, healthy feeling, because i know they are getting their answers, and they are getting the original and full answer, not an exhausted 5th time answer."

Are you going to mock my question by filing it into a list of similar questions?,no.
"As a musician, do you feel left out that most people can't hear music the way you do and feel the same stuff in it you feel?","wait wait hold on a second. i hear and feel music just the same as any normal human. i just analyze the shit out of those feelings. and yes i'm lonely that more people aren't doing that, but oh well."
You write some of the best melodies of any living composer. Do you ever feel bad that your talent isn't more recognized and featured in big ways in the music community?,"relax, i've barely even started yet."

"Hello, Bill, so you know those how are you questions and how you have a link to them cuz they're FAQ and your answer on that page is good? But you can't know how you'd be in the future, so this is clearly a lie. And you're prepared to lie with this answer for the rest of time, so you were lying from the beginning, and everything's a lie every time! If good is the lie then bad must be the truth. Are you actually bad all the time?*Ms. Mary Jane?","i only link to a FAQ page if my current answer matches the answer in the faq page. in some cases, i actually change the answer in the faq if i would like to change it. in some cases where the answer only applies NOW and didn't apply before, i might even remove the earlier asks and put them on a separate page with the earlier answer which would have been true before."

history of the places people have asked you to do a history of video?,i have it.
Pandora or Spotify?,"fuck that, let's all just email each other our music collections and listen to them."
"Whenever I'm working on art projects and stuff, I always push myself too hard and give up whenever my technical/physical skills aren't good enough to reproduce the ideas I have in my mind. As a result, I never seem to finish most of the projects I start. Any advice?","do simpler and shorter projects. once you've got that down, then you can figure out how to make them more complicated and longer."
Where do you generally get ideas for each project from?,

"You're lyrics are quirky and mystifying but usually appear to have no meaning. [they make me happy]But when making lyrics for your songs, do you just think something that makes no sense, make it make sense, then not care that it still doesn't make sense? Or is there a deep, deep meaning to the colossal and mystifying words in your songs that appear to acquire a gaping void of misunderstanding and disconnect with the fundamental principles of philosophy and language itself!?","i really enjoy trick meaning. where you can feel the meaning, but it seems to have come from nowhere. but it's not the lyrics, or the music. it only works when you use them together."

WhEn ArE yOu SuPpOsEd To UsE cApItAl LeTtErS?,"according to the British Royal Crown, you are supposed to capitalize the first letter of every sentence, and also the first word of important things or people, such as the Queen of England, or Harvard University. in my experience, this doesn't really help in communication, and almost hinders it, because you are giving off the impression that you are writing some kind of official document, and possibly not saying what you really mean. The times i prefer to use capitals are in acronyms (like NAFTA, or UNESCO), sometimes at the beginning of sentences if i feel i am changing gear or tone (similar to the way you might use a paragraph break) or also when i want to emphasize one word, i may capitalize the first letter of that word, creating something similar to a."

I just read that Newt Gingrich is polling high as a potential VP candidate. Maybe you can brush the dust off that song out you referenced 4.16.12 1:05pm and it will be relevant again.,"believe it or not, that song actually came up on my short randomized list (of 4 songs, starting with abc) and i made some adjustments and re-finalized the writing. but after recording abc, i realized i have to do another history video. so that is what i am doing, and it's going to be a long one. trust me, i have thought about the newt gingrich song, especially since it came up, and i find it is only a source of stress. all the details in the song are about 2012 anyway, so either way it is a throwback. plus the subject matter is completely ridiculous, so it's not really going to matter that much either way. it is best not to worry about the timing regarding the news cycle. i have to finish this history video."
Any chance to get a little progress update on your longer project(s)?,"still writing. trying to fit a massive, massive amount of information into a very tightly packaged narrative. the process is full of puzzles and riddles, but it is very exciting. looking forward to solidifying the script so i can move forward to making the thing."

Like do you do it often?,"i have one large randomized list, and i let it run mainly at 2 different times -- when i have a lot of questions to answer, and when i am alligning captions in a video. both are mindless tasks that don't require me to hear anything. also if i am walking a long distance, which is a hobby but i only do it when my car is being fixed."

Anything. just go through the motions of using those programs together. that is how you start doing exactly what i am doing. you will learn everything else from there."

what is a nice thing you have learned while editing video?,"many things. here's one. The program i'm using doesn't have enough keyboard shortcuts, which is really problematic for working fast. But maybe a year after i had been using it and doing videos every day, i found an insane work around.  On a mac, there is a help menu, which seems to have access to EVERY menu command, and it is searchable. So if i type ⌘? and then the first 2 (or 3) letters of the menu command, then hit enter, it works. Sure, it's like 8 keystrokes, but once you get fast at it, it is almost as good as having a key-command. Finding a keyboard shortcut for something that doesn't have a keyboard shortcut is a huge victory if you are trying to make content as fast as humanly possible."
Why do you create things?,
"I want to get into writing and playing music, but I'm not sure if I should take music classes and piano lessons and learn music theory or try to figure it all out on my own. Is this a Do what you want, everyone is different sort of thing? Do you feel that knowing theory and/or having training has been essential for making the music you write and play?","i think the only way to really learn music right is to learn it yourself. there is no right or wrong way to do anything, so you have to learn it the way it means most to you. then again, i am probably insane."

Do you go to church?,"for work, yes."
What did you mean when you sang that you were going to make things right in your new alphabet video?,"making things right' seems to be a frequent go-to line for me, and i have probably used it in many songs. (for example, future song, written 2009) It just always feels right to say it. and it's true, of course i want to make things right. it's just common sense i gues."

"since you seem to have much more shorter content than longer content, which do you prefer making? I imagine that longer content is more difficult but is it overall more rewarding than shorter stuff? To me, they both seem equally as fun?","really short stuff is a good way to get started if you have wanted to make stuff for years but still haven't put anything out yet. it was a great trick! i was able to start putting stuff out, and i learned a lot. then i got really tired of doing short stuff and scaled it way back to start doing long stuff, but then all of a sudden my vine channel got a lot of attention, so i figured it was a bad time to stop. so i ended up doing even shorter content for ANOTHER 6 months, after i had already felt like i had done enough. it was still fun, and i learned a lot, but i was way overdue for some longer stuff. and then finally i couldn't take it anymore and took a risk and switched to longer stuff. only problem is it takes way longer to make, but i have done way way too much short stuff at this point. there's more than enough out there for people to watch."

Do you prefer getting the more serious questions or the silly ones?,do i have to decide.
"this clave is not Nigerian, is it?. and if i'm not mistaken I think it goes like (and it starts on the last A)AaAaAAaAaAaA?","the 'clave' or whatever it's really called, has seemed to permeate the globe throughout every time period. but i can confirm, from playing in a nigerian church, that all the up-tempo songs are based rhythmically around 2 rhythms, which seem to correspond nearly exactly with what i have heard through the grape vine to be the so called clave rhythms. one in 4/4 using 16th notes (AaaAaaAaaaAaAaaa) and one at the same tempo using triplets instead, and the rhythm is (AaAaaAaAaAaa). they don't have a name for it, but it is always those 2 rhythms."

Do you like the number 8? I do.,i like all the numbers.

Do you expect to one day transcend to a new plane of existence?,seems like a good idea.
How to win the favor of a lady?,"be yourself, i guess?"
are you making any decent money off of Spotify? it seems like other musicians prefer Bandcamp cause they can a bigger cut of the money? i guess your probably more about what's convenient for your fans?,"i don't have a choice. spotify owns the world. They are a total nightmare. i have to pay TWO (2) different services just to have the right to upload my own music. and i had to jump through multiple hoops and go through long waiting periods just to get there. And they won't let me upload my own profile pic. and there are all kinds of crazy restrictions on graphics, and they basically don't let you do anything yourself. you have to pay the authorities to do everything. and the companies keep most of the money. But for some reason, they have managed to lure almost 100% of the world's population into using spotify as their only source for music. so i really don't have a choice. they own the game."
hey why was the room in some of your pics covered in quotes?,
"do you ever feel like all the interactions you have online, and questions your receive, are actually computers randomly generating interaction to keep the fact that your universe is actually the size of a city that constantly generates new ways to prove it's own reality to the main character of a shitty story plot (yourself/myself)?",no.

"Working on projects has never fallen into a flow for me unless I have a deadline. When I don't have a deadline they feel kind of dissatisfactory and give me a weird feeling in my stomach - it's kinda miserable.

why do people keep sending u the bee movie script???? dont they think it'd get annoying for you??!!,you just answered your own question.
About how long will your this long video you're working on be? I ask because you say you might be finished by christmas and I take everything seriously and also I don't know how far away christmas is but I think it's far off.,"my original goal was to make it somewhere between 5 and 10 minutes. writing the script now, and it clocks in at about 5:40 and i JUST got to what is supposed to be the main topic of the video. it's like if you are making a video about fruit, and you are 5 minutes into the video and you just got to the part that talks about the fruit. So that tells me that the total length of the video should probably be at least double what i have so far. If i can get it to work in 10min, that would be great. if it goes up to 15 min and stays engaging and interesting all the way through, i think that would be fine. Japan video was 9, and it took 98 days of solid work to finish it, but i was also doing 6 second vines every day for most of that time, which i am now not doing. also i have probably learned some things from experience and perhaps things will move faster. then again, this video might require many new kinds of graphics tricks. i am working as fast as possible, as always."

Yes, Your Honor,we're ready to proceed.Mr. Montgomery,your opening statement, please.Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,my grandmother was a simple woman.Born on a farm, she believedit was man's divine rightto benefit from the bountyof nature God put before us.If we lived in the topsy-turvy worldMr. Benson imagines,just think of what would it mean.I would have to negotiatewith the silkwormfor the elastic in my britches!Talking bee!How do we know this isn't some sort ofholographic motion-picture-captureHollywood wizardry?They could be using laser beams!Robotics! Ventriloquism!Oloning! For all we know,he could be on steroids!Mr. Benson?Ladies and gentlemen,there's no trickery here.I'm just an ordinary bee.Honey's pretty important to me.It's important to all bees.We invented it!We make it. And we protect itwith our lives.Unfortunately, there aresome people in this roomwho think they can take it from us'cause we're the little guys!I'm hoping that, after this is all over,you'll see how, by taking our honey,you not only take everything we havebut everything we are!I wish he'd dress like thatall the time. So nice!Oall your first witness.So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhaydenof Honey Farms, big company you have.I suppose so.I see you also ownHoneyburton and Honron!Yes, they provide beekeepersfor our farms.Beekeeper. I find thatto be a very disturbing term.I don't imagine you employany bee-free-ers, do you?- No.- I couldn't hear you.- No.- No.Because you don't free bees.You keep bees.

And so herewe have yet another exampleof bee culture casuallystolen by a humanfor nothing more thana prance-about stage name.Oh, please.Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?Because I'm feelinga little stung, Sting.Or should I say...

We have that in common.Do we?Bees have 100 percent employment,but we do jobs like taking the crud out.That's just whatI was thinking about doing.Ken, I let Barry borrow your razorfor his fuzz. I hope that was all right.I'm going to drain the old stinger.Yeah, you do that.Look at that.You know, I've just about had itwith your little mind games.- What's that?- Italian Vogue.Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.A lot of ads.Remember what Van said, why isyour life more valuable than mine?Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!I think something stinks in here!I love the smell of flowers.How do you like the smell of flames?!Not as much.Water bug!

I like it!I always felt there was some kindof barrier between Ken and me.I couldn't overcome it.Oh, well.Are you OK for the trial?I believe Mr. Montgomeryis about out of ideas.We would like to callMr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.Good idea! You can really see why he'sconsidered one of the best lawyers...Yeah.Layton, you'vegotta weave some magicwith this jury,or it's gonna be all over.Don't worry. The only thing I haveto do to turn this jury aroundis to remind themof what they don't like about bees.- You got the tweezers?- Are you allergic?Only to losing, son. Only to losing.Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask youwhat I think we'd all like to know.What exactly is your relationshipto that woman?We're friends.- Good friends?- Yes.How good?

Yes, Your Honor!Where is the rest of your team?Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,and as a result,we don't make very good time.I actually heard a funny story about...Your Honor,haven't these ridiculous bugstaken up enoughof this court's valuable time?How much longer will we allowthese absurd shenanigans to go on?They have presented no compellingevidence to support their chargesagainst my clients,who run legitimate businesses.I move for a complete dismissalof this entire case!Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm goingto have to considerMr. Montgomery's motion.But you can't! We have a terrific case.Where is your proof?Where is the evidence?Show me the smoking gun!Hold it, Your Honor!You want a smoking gun?Here is your smoking gun.What is that?It's a bee smoker!What, this?This harmless little contraption?This couldn't hurt a fly,let alone a bee.Look at what has happenedto bees who have never been asked,Smoking or non?Is this what nature intended for us?To be forcibly addictedto smoke machinesand man-made wooden slat work camps?Living out our lives as honey slavesto the white man?- What are we gonna do?- He's playing the species card.Ladies and gentlemen, please,free these bees!Free the bees! Free the bees!Free the bees!Free the bees! Free the bees!The court finds in favor of the bees!Vanessa, we won!I knew you could do it! High-five!Sorry.I'm OK! You know what this means?All the honeywill finally belong to the bees.Now we won't haveto work so hard all the time.This is an unholy perversionof the balance of nature, Benson.You'll regret this.Barry, how much honey is out there?All right. One at a time.Barry, who are you wearing?My sweater is Ralph Lauren,and I have no pants.- What if Montgomery's right?- What do you mean?We've been living the bee waya long time, 27 million years.Oongratulations on your victory.What will you demand as a settlement?First, we'll demand a complete shutdownof all bee work camps.Then we want back the honeythat was ours to begin with,every last drop.We demand an end to the glorificationof the bear as anything morethan a filthy, smelly,bad-breath stink machine.We're all awareof what they do in the woods.Wait for my signal.Take him out.He'll have nauseousfor a few hours, then he'll be fine.And we will no longer toleratebee-negative nicknames...But it's just a prance-about stage name!...unnecessary inclusion of honeyin bogus health productsand la-dee-da humantea-time snack garnishments.Oan't breathe.Bring it in, boys!Hold it right there! Good.Tap it.Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,and there's gallons more coming!- I think we need to shut down!- Shut down? We've never shut down.Shut down honey production!Stop making honey!Turn your key, sir!What do we do now?Oannonball!We're shutting honey production!Mission abort.Aborting pollination and nectar detail.Returning to base.Adam, you wouldn't believehow much honey was out there.Oh, yeah?What's going on? Where is everybody?- Are they out celebrating?- They're home.They don't know what to do.Laying out, sleeping in.I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his wayto San Antonio with a cricket.At least we got our honey back.Sometimes I think, so what if humansliked our honey? Who wouldn't?It's the greatest thing in the world!I was excited to be part of making it.This was my new desk. This was mynew job. I wanted to do it really well.And now...Now I can't.I don't understandwhy they're not happy.I thought their lives would be better!They're doing nothing. It's amazing.Honey really changes people.You don't have any ideawhat's going on, do you?- What did you want to show me?- This.What happened here?That is not the half of it.Oh, no. Oh, my.They're all wilting.Doesn't look very good, does it?No.And whose fault do you think that is?You know, I'm gonna guess bees.Bees?Specifically, me.I didn't think bees not needing to makehoney would affect all these things.It's notjust flowers.Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.That's our whole SAT test right there.Take away produce, that affectsthe entire animal kingdom.And then, of course...The human species?So if there's no more pollination,it could all just go south here,couldn't it?I know this is also partly my fault.How about a suicide pact?How do we do it?- I'll sting you, you step on me.- Thatjust kills you twice.Right, right.Listen, Barry...sorry, but I gotta get going.I had to open my mouth and talk.Vanessa?Vanessa? Why are you leaving?Where are you going?To the final Tournament of Roses paradein Pasadena.They've moved it to this weekendbecause all the flowers are dying.It's the last chanceI'll ever have to see it.Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.I never meant it to turn out like this.I know.

It's real.Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.Thank you. It was a gift.Once inside,we just pick the right float.How about The Princess and the Pea?I could be the princess,and you could be the pea!Yes, I got it.- Where should I sit?- What are you?- I believe I'm the pea.- The pea?It goes under the mattresses.- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.- I'm getting the marshal.You do that!This whole parade is a fiasco!Let's see what this baby'll do.Hey, what are you doing?!Then all we dois blend in with traffic......without arousing suspicion.Once at the airport,there's no stopping us.Stop! Security.- You and your insect pack your float?- Yes.Has it beenin your possession the entire time?Would you remove your shoes?- Remove your stinger.- It's part of me.I know. Just having some fun.Enjoy your flight.Then if we're lucky, we'll havejust enough pollen to do the job.Oan you believe how lucky we are? Wehave just enough pollen to do the job!I think this is gonna work.It's got to work.Attention, passengers,this is Oaptain Scott.We have a bit of bad weatherin New York.It looks like we'll experiencea couple hours delay.Barry, these are cut flowerswith no water.

My entire species...What are you doing?- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!- Who's an attorney?Don't move.Oh, Barry.Good afternoon, passengers.This is your captain.Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24Bplease report to the cockpit?And please hurry!What happened here?There was a DustBuster,a toupee, a life raft exploded.One's bald, one's in a boat,they're both unconscious!- Is that another bee joke?- No!No one's flying the plane!This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.What's your status?This is Vanessa Bloome.I'm a florist from New York.Where's the pilot?He's unconscious,and so is the copilot.Not good.

Oh, great.Vanessa, this is nothing morethan a big metal bee.It's got giant wings, huge engines.I can't fly a plane.- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?- Yes.How hard could it be?Wait, Barry!We're headed into some lightning.This is Bob Bumble. We have somelate-breaking news from JFK Airport,where a suspenseful sceneis developing.Barry Benson,fresh from his legal victory...That's Barry!...is attempting to land a plane,loaded with people, flowersand an incapacitated flight crew.Flowers?!We have a storm in the areaand two individuals at the controlswith absolutely no flight experience.Just a minute.There's a bee on that plane.I'm quite familiar with Mr. Bensonand his no-account compadres.They've done enough damage.But isn't he your only hope?Technically, a beeshouldn't be able to fly at all.Their wings are too small...Haven't we heard this a million times?The surface area of the wingsand body mass make no sense.- Get this on the air!- Got it.- Stand by.- We're going live.The way we work may be a mystery to you.Making honey takes a lot of beesdoing a lot of small jobs.But let me tell you about a small job.If you do it well,it makes a big difference.More than we realized.To us, to everyone.That's why I want to get beesback to working together.That's the bee way!We're not made of Jell-O.We get behind a fellow.- Black and yellow!- Hello!Left, right, down, hover.- Hover?- Forget hover.This isn't so hard.Beep-beep!

Move it out!Move out!Our only chance is if I do what I'd do,you copy me with the wings of the plane!Don't have to yell.I'm not yelling!We're in a lot of trouble.It's very hard to concentratewith that panicky tone in your voice!It's not a tone. I'm panicking!I can't do this!Vanessa, pull yourself together.You have to snap out of it!You snap out of it.You snap out of it.- You snap out of it!- You snap out of it!- You snap out of it!- You snap out of it!- You snap out of it!- You snap out of it!- Hold it!- Why? Oome on, it's my turn.How is the plane flying?I don't know.Hello?Benson, got any flowersfor a happy occasion in there?The Pollen Jocks!They do get behind a fellow.- Black and yellow.- Hello.All right, let's drop this tin canon the blacktop.Where?

Ready, boys?Affirmative!Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.Land on that flower!Ready? Full reverse!Spin it around!- Not that flower! The other one!- Which one?- That flower.- I'm aiming at the flower!That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.I mean the giant pulsating flowermade of millions of bees!Pull forward. Nose down.

Don't be afraid.Smell it. Full reverse!Just drop it. Be a part of it.Aim for the center!Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!Oome on, already.Barry, we did it!You taught me how to fly!- Yes. No high-five!- Right.Barry, it worked!Did you see the giant flower?What giant flower? Where? Of courseI saw the flower! That was genius!- Thank you.- But we're not done yet.Listen, everyone!This runway is coveredwith the last pollenfrom the last flowersavailable anywhere on Earth.That means this is our last chance.We're the only ones who make honey,pollinate flowers and dress like this.If we're gonna survive as a species,this is our moment!

Are you ever frustrated by the people who don't like your short content?,"short content is the reason i was able to get a following in the first place. i never wanted to make as much of it as i did, i was just carrying on because that was where the following was growing, and that was the only way i could ever get anyone to watch anything longer. ironically, now that i have both followings, they seem to be fighting with each other. i honestly am long overdue for long content, so that is what i want to do. but i was trying to mix it up and now i don't know what to think. but what i really want is to do longer stuff now, because it's long overdue. the short stuff was really just a ticket to break the ice."

have you ever considered making a video where you harmonize the questions from this page and then answer them with a jingle?,"that seems like a good idea. but i am currently working on a long video and then i plan on doing a steady stream of songs for a while. i dunno, people have gotten pretty mad lately when i do short content. i realize i have 2 separate fan bases, but i think the one that likes long content has gotten bigger. either way, i have already done way way more short content, so it makes sense that i catch up on all the longer stuff i have always wanted to do."

The expert mode page has something called vacationing in the center of the earth which I'm guessing got lost in the Japan shuffle. Did you just decide not to release it?,
"I didn't know that reality page existed, it's actually interesting seeing those off the cuff monologues. Quick question, are some of those from your car? They sound like you're driving during half of them.",

Why did you make a snail time without a jail time?,because i knew there would be a demand for it. and i was right:.
Can I has snail time full extended version w/o jail time?,so i figured i might as well make it before someone takes it upon themself to make their own (which is exactly what happened with babies/grownups).
Is it ok to be angry?,maybe.
When did you first start singing?,highschool i guess.
how do I get over my anxiety and ask you a question?,i don't know.
Could you give a list of the songs that you primarily wrote using your murder your demon technique?,"hard to define which ones exactly use it .... the idea of starting with junk was an idea i started toying as early as feb 2009 .... 15 minutes (nov 2009) probably uses it. but rabbit snakes is really the first time i really used it. (12.25.09) i was just so frustrated with not being able to decide what to do in a song, that i was like, ok .... what's the worst thing that could happen if i just say 'rabbit snakes' like this, right at the top? and then the song bloomed into all kinds of interesting things, including obscure dead-beatle conspiracy references. dance the was written probably on the same day, and absolutely starts with garbage, just the same way. eat bread also was written at that time, as well as trees / everything (this one uses major garbage in the second verse.) i'm a diamond (apr 2010) is a very clear example. starting in august 2010, i started writing a LOT more, and used that a lot. that's when i came up with the name for the concept ('murder your demon') and you get songs like 2010, the summertime, pretty much everything from aug 2010 (also recorded at that time). i like. modern woes. There are many many many more songs written from 09, 10, .. only a small percentage of them got recorded (it takes much longer to record a song than to write it, and i wrote way too much). in the second half of 2010 i probably wrote more than any other time.... ('dream of evil' came from that time, not sure if that exactly uses 'demon' technique because i don't think any of those parts were specifically deliberately throw-away.) in 2011 i made a big effort to try to write in a more 'normal' way, so there are not any examples from 2011. (well, maybe from early 2011 you have 'skip to my loo'). near the end of 2011 you have 'write a tune that really sucks' that was just a one-off. (also that is an example where instead of going into something non-garbage, it just ends instead. that's an alternate strategy). 2012/13 was all gathering and updating all the existing songs, so not too many new ones got started. but there was one random library session in june 2013 where i wrote several, just like the old days. tuesday is the main example (and actually kind of a tutorial on how the technique works)."
what is your greatest skill?,i am pretty good at telling the difference between a car and a truck.
is it ok to use military force to make someone like me?,"i'm not sure, but people have been doing it for thousands of years."
"I used to play guitar but became very bored of playing. Learning songs is boring, playing in front of people has no positive effect (it's like playing normally but making a mistake is more embarassing), and I hate learning about music stuff. I find that playing my own little creations is more interesting than anything else but I do not find learning new things fun. So I don't exactly have any idea of what to do about my guitar situation. I have some skill in playing, but no knowledge or want for knowledge of music. I haven't played for months at this point and have considered playing more but I do not know what to play. So I guess what I'm trying to ask through all of this, is, have you gone through times like this, where you do not like music and don't want to play? And, how long did you take to really figure out what you want to do in music? I have a feeling I am thinking about this with too much structure.",i have never felt that way about music. that's one of the ways i know it is the right thing for me.
Do you dislike it when people use big or uncommon words to show their superiority over other people who don't use those words?,yes.

why is my lampshade green?,"i don't know, but mine is too. i like it."
"do you believe all life experiences are valuable, even if they are extremely bad?",i think so.
"After following your stuff now for a bit, I think I see now that you really just want to make everything that you can possibly make.  (A fascinating pursuit, even if it's a bit strange.)  What I'm wondering though, is what this means for quality control?  So, for instance, would you rather create 100 kind-of okay-ish videos/songs, or 1 really really good one?  And if you found one specific thing that meant the world to you, would you be willing to drop everything to work on just that project, or would you rather be working on having more things done for people to see at the end of the day?  (sorry for this question being so wordy, i almost feel bad making you read all this)?","i am trying to do the best stuff i can. but sometimes if you are thinking like that, you won't do anything. at a certain point, you realize that every song or story is only good because there is something wrong with it. the main character has to have a problem in order for the story to mean anything. music has to have something 'bad' or 'wrong' about it, in order for you to feel the healing from that problem. So the more you try to search for the 'perfect' song, you will only realize that the only perfect song is total silence..... which is pointless. Over and over again i have tried to hone in on the right music and it continues to be impossible, and that is what has always led me to just dig in and start going crazy. in the end, i am a perfectionist, so even if i work on a very strange song or project, i am still going to take care to make sure that it is as good as possible. Also, very important to remember, is that the more you do, the better you get. this is the."

"What was the thinking behind the series where you sang about objects or other random live video (i.e. not graphics)? Such as bread, tape, iron my shoes, colonization, mail you my floor?","it was just a good way to start out making videos when i didn't really know what to do, but felt like i could do anything. the first 3 were done in 2011 (bed, bowl, foot) and then i didn't do any videos for a long time (was mostly writing and recording songs.) then in 2014 i spontaneously put together a 5-day video."
how DO you get organized enough to start really creating content? i'm really bad at this and would like advice?,"wait and stay confused for as long as possible, until you can't take it anymore. for details on how i did it, click."
hey bill how you doing?,
Will you ever write a book?,"i will be using language in many many ways to write and create content for the rest of my life. in some periods in history that meant writing a book. in today's world, in my opinion, it does not."
any tips on how you write those atonal-sounding grooves that don't sound entirely random?,"i usually start with the keyboard (chord/rhythm) track... (well, no, actually the drums/perc would come first) and just hit it and go. and just kind of do whatever. then i might add a couple of other things .... the bass actually comes kind of late in the game, so i might not even decide on where the root of the key is until i hear how the other parts go together .... who am i kidding, that is not an explanation. i have no idea how i do it. it's not really that atonal. you're never really too far outside the realm of a certain key. and usually when i do it, (especially when i do the bass) i do have a certain 'root of the key' note in mind, even if i totally disobey it. maybe if you pick a track you can email me about it and i might be able to break it down."

"Do you find yourself wanting to create things that YOU want to make, or do you want to create things OTHERS want to see?  Like, percentage wise, i mean.  (Personally i'm like 90% me/10% others.)  This is a topic that fascinates me for some reason.","throughout my life, i have turned away from 'catering to specific audiences' at every juncture. when i finally got myself organized enough to start really creating content, i was so far down the road to no-man's land that there was no turning back. it was still even a few more years after that until i actually had any audience. now that i have an audience, it can actually be easy to forget that i am supposed to be playing entirely my own game!! and forgetting that causes only stress. so i regularly have to remind myself that i am still supposed to be playing my own game, and to try to transport back to 2013 and 2014 when absolutely no one told me what to do."

Do you ever feel really paranoid at night and can't sleep?

Did you really drop yourself on your head when you were young? Were you hanging upside down from something and fell?,"my mom was carrying me and i jumped, and landed on my face. you might blame her, but it was not her fault. i jumped."
Why don't you put some of your reality videos on your vine account to explain to your vine followers why you aren't making as many vines?,"putting journal or improv clips on the main channels has proved to be a disaster. no matter how clearly i put the date, people still assume it's brand new. i still have people asking if they can meet me at kosciuszko street. also the journals are very low production, and very personal. also that's not the reason i'm not doing vines. the reason i'm not doing vines is because when youtube people see 6 second content they threaten to murder me."

Has Rationalism gone to far? Will there still be a place for Piety?,maybe they can both exist? i have never used the word piety in my life on earth (i don't know what it means) and rationalism sounds like an over complicated word for 'being reasonable' but it might refer to a specific european thinking trend at some point in history that i don't remember.
"In your video the high class stuff, how did you animate the sheet music?","i will explain a single page first (the multi-page spread is another issue)... let's say there is just one page of notation, like 8 bars or whatever.... I make the notation in a notation program, and screenshot it. (then i actually make several allignment adjustments in graphics, because notation programs are incredibly finicky, it's easier to adjust things in graphics)... then i save it how i want. then i use graphics to erase the last note (and any chord that goes along with it.) i erase notes on a staff by just dragging empty staff over it. and i save as and then add a 1 to the file name. repeat, keep erasing the next note and 'save as'. then you have a stack of files all in order. then import. then allign the timing. it's the exact same way i do text, but with text i type it out and screenshot each frame, and delete words (easier, instead of erasing them). the delete technique would not work in a notation program, because the notes and allignment will change as you delete them. that's why i use graphics. it's not that hard, and i'm not even using a graphics program. just an image preview program, and i'm just copying and pasting boxes. the mccartney video was a bit more ambitious because i wanted to do a steady scroll. so i thought it would be good to make one huge image file that is the entire length of the score. and then do the erase per frame technique.... so then all the frames were huge... and then export that to a really high res video and scroll the video??? i don't remember if this was successful, but you run into major problems when you try to do huge things like that. processing power limitations, etc. Same sort of crisis occured when i was trying to do the zoom out on the japanese army. i ended up having to sonehow break the task into smaller pieces. if i recall. i somehow succeeded in gettiing a steady scroll on the notation, only to find out that it was too hard to read when it's moving like that!! so i ended up keeping it still and then sliding forward page by page. if i had known the steady scroll wasn't going to work, i probably would have broken it into pages from the start. i was on a 7 day vine schedule at that time, so that video was an insane time crunch, and the notation took me from about 3am straight through the entire day until 4 pm and was barely on time for work. (not to mention COMPOSING the rhythms and chords, and composing the notation, before animating it.) it was a bad and unhealthy time crunch. i suppose thats what you get for attempting a 30 sec (45 sec? whatever it is) video in place of a 6 second video. was in such a rush, there is a smudge in the youtube version (a stray piece of a note that didn't get erased fully)."

Like, does having an infinite amount of time actually permit an infinite amount of things, or do the two infinities just sort of converge at some point and you end up with something inbetween everything and nothing?  (also do you even think along these lines, sorry if this makes no sense)?",it would solve some problems and probably create entirely different problems.

I remember you answered a question once saying that if finishing college is what it takes to be smart, then you'd rather be stupid, or something along those lines. is stupid song kind of within that same context?","i wasn't really thinking about the content. i was mainly doing an exercise in writing more normal songs. it uses a chordal loop, which is something i normally don't do. the lyrics just came out of thin air, i didn't really think about it."

"are you manually doing text effects for your videos? if so, doesn't that take forever? wouldn't it be quicker to use some kind of text effect plugin?","i do them manually, and i do them differently every time. i am not interested in having only one way to do it. that's one reason i don't use a plug-in, another reason i don't use a plug-in is because my computer is old and i need to keep everything very simple. and i can't get a new computer because the program i'm using is obsolete, so the program won't work on a new computer, and i will have to start all over and re-learn everything on a new program."

"i have a program called fl studio, do you know if this is any good or not?","i have never used it. whether a program is good or not depends on what you are looking to do, and it also depends on how well you know the program. and if you don't know any program, then the simplest ones will be the best."

do you find now with your style of writing at the keyboard that there is less difference between trying to write and just trying to improv and go crazy? does it mostly depend on whatever your mindset or intention is at the time?,"i think the writing is just as connected (or not connected) to improv regardless of whether i'm doing it the old way or the new way. the main difference is, with the new way, there is more brainstorming and asking questions about what works and doesn't work, and i can try many different things. where as with the old way, (paper only) i have to just start at the beginning, and make decisions and keep it and go forward-- i can't really go back."
