"Why do the key changes at the prechoruses of we could just get high not follow a pattern? (D to A, D to C#, G# to Bb)?","why would they follow a pattern? the human listener notices how it feels, not how it looks when you analyze it on paper. it's kind of like how stories have twists and turns and surprises. Actually, i was stumped on this song for months -- i had verse 1, cho, verse 2, and just was losing momentum in the second chorus --- that was before i had the idea for the second key change. then all of a sudden it occured to me to put the second chorus in a much different key, and that really sparked the right feeling at that point in the song. The first chorus already sort of had that effect (raised a whole step), and it was a natural continuation of the 'liberating/escape' feeling to have the second chorus be unexpectedly even more adventurous. From that point on, it was just a delicate balance of where i thought it should go next, and i just listened carefully to where it wanted to go from there, and the song was finished very quickly."
have you ever had lucid dreams?,

"so, if you'll allow me to be the advocate of some non-corporeal thing other than the devil. it is intuitive to you that everyone else would want to have the same unending desire to create that you do. so, in the world of all bill wurtzes, are you all in churches somewhere making history videos? or do you occasionally check in on each other and see if you can say the same thing at the same time without planning ahead?",i'm not sure i understand the question. but i will say the main thing i do is not to make history videos.

"what are advantages to playing 5-string bass  instead of a 4-string bass, and should i throw my 5-string bass away? or sell it?","the advantages are the low notes between B and E. you can certainly live without B, but if you really have to live without that Eb, you could find yourself in some sad situations. however, if you are clever, you can learn to survive just fine. after all, everyone got along just fine until the 1980s. personally, i use at least down to Db quite frequently. In modern times, i have found that many players use an octave doubler (with a 4 string) when they need those notes. however, some players choose to use the octave doubler irresponsibly, and they go way below B, resulting in a rumbly mess, and also being punched in the face by me."
what is your vocal range?,

"Since making the 'History of Japan' video, nonetheless having it go viral, do you feel you have set a standard for what your 'big projects' should gravitate towards?

I want you to be able to publish content you feel expresses your views and ideologies through the art form you feel most comfortable in.)?","i will be doing a wide range of things. the next video will hopefully be within the same realm as history of japan, while also expanding widely beyond it. also i will be doing weekly song releases after the video is done."
How would you define a soul?,someone.
what's the weirdest time signature you've ever written in?,"when the time sigs get weird, they don't necessarily want to stay the same. some songs i've done go to mars with the time, but it is not staying in one. an example would be all u gotta do is and there are a few other examples which are probably not recorded yet."

i'm trying to transcribe a song but i can't make out the voicing of the last chord. do you have any ideas? https://clyp.it/qlx11xk1?,"well, the first instinct is that it's a standard 5 chord from Fmin, with all the dirty notes -- mainly including the 'dirtiest' note, Gb. so the melody is on top (c, 2 oct above middle C) then right under it you have Ab in the piano, then E under that, and down in the lower octave you have Gb, and then Db (next to middle C). by 'law' it feels like Bb has to be in this chord, and I am almost certain it is. usually Bb likes to go next to middle C, in that range, for these chords. certainly it is C7, b9, b13, b5 (oh also, no one would be playing a G note, i can guarantee that, there is no room for that, they are already playing all the other notes, plus we just came from a G rooted chord). so that is my best assessment. the note that makes this chord sound extra dirty is the Gb. all the other notes are completely standard for c7 in f minor."
Are you able to tell if someone types something into the reality password box and hits enter or it just a typable box that leads to nowhere but the wrong password page?,it's fake.
are you interesting?,i will check.
"i have a specific question, i hope you don't mind answering it. in your world what is your name for this particular chord voicing? starting on D just below middle C and going upD F# G D E? commonly played on guitar.Dadd4add9? D4add9? D24? wtf?","well, it's kind of like you have red and blue at the same time. what you call it depends on what's around it. like if the entire canvas is red, and then some parts of it had blue also, you would call those parts the 'blue parts' and not mention the red. but if the entire canvas was blue and red, then you would call all the parts blue and red. what i'm trying to say is, that chord is full blown D and Dsus2/4 at the same time. but from a song perspective, it is likely that you may alternate that chord with just regular D. if that is the case, like in the all red (and some blue) painting, you would call it D2/4, because that's the part that has D2/4, and the regular D part doesn't. but if you were playing only entirely that chord (with the 2 and 4 and 1 and 3 together) for the whole time, then you might as well say D add this add that add everything including the kitchen sink. Also the reader will have more time to read it if it's the only chord on a page. but if it is in a song where regular D chords are also used, then i would def. just say D2/4 and it's players choice if u wanna open it all up like that."

How much do you have of the current video? How long is it planned to be?,"script is written up to 8 minutes, which feels like about 60%. seems like it is in danger of being 15+ minutes, but i am going to really really try to keep it under 12. i will let you know how it times out when the script is finished, and that should be an accurate time length."

Do you ever get anxiety?,maybe not.
how did the video and the song hi it's 1995 came out what was the inspiration for that video?,"was written sometime in 2013, i was mostly doing revises and edits for existing songs, i don't know why the 1995 one came to me out of nowhere. being short, it reached 100% completion automatically, so it ended up in the 'completed songs' list which formed itself and then was arranged in order of time length, during 2013. and i started recording shortest-first, so naturally 1995 was one of the first ones. also, during 2013 i was trying to get started doing videos for them, which i was ALSO starting with shortest first. 1995 was sort of a stray, i was almost giving up on shortest first, and i had just finished building the website, and this was right before i spontaneously started the 5-day schedule. the concept for the video seemed straight forward. so i brainstormed a list of all the items - there were probably about 20-25 relevant items i came up with and found images for. and then i spent some time figuring out which ones to put where in the 5x3 grid. interestingly enough, a year later when i edited it for vine, i had room for one more item (vines are square, so it became a 4x4 grid, 16 items instead of 15.) so there is actually 1 additional item that got added to the vine edit."
But what do i do if i feel like i don't fit in at home? i can't get along with my dad and i feel like nobody else understands me?,"congratulations, you are human."

"Dear Sir:I have been requested by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company to contact you for assistance in resolving a matter. The Nigerian National Petroleum Company has recently concluded a large number of contracts for oil exploration in the sub-Sahara region. The contracts have immediately produced moneys equaling US$40,000,000. The Nigerian National Petroleum Company is desirous of oil exploration in other parts of the world, however, because of certain regulations of the Nigerian Government, it is unable to move these funds to another region.You assistance is requested as a non-Nigerian citizen to assist the Nigerian National Petroleum Company, and also the Central Bank of Nigeria, in moving these funds out of Nigeria. If the funds can be transferred to your name, in your United States account, then you can forward the funds as directed by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company. In exchange for your accommodating services, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company would agree to allow you to retain 10%, or US$4 million of this amount.However, to be a legitimate transferee of these moneys according to Nigerian law, you must presently be a depositor of at least US$100,000 in a Nigerian bank which is regulated by the Central Bank of Nigeria.If it will be possible for you to assist us, we would be most grateful. We suggest that you meet with us in person in Lagos, and that during your visit I introduce you to the representatives of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company, as well as with certain officials of the Central Bank of Nigeria.Please call me at your earliest convenience at 18-467-4975. Time is of the essence in this matter; very quickly the Nigerian Government will realize that the Central Bank is maintaining this amount on deposit, and attempt to levy certain depository taxes on it.Yours truly,Prince Alyusi Islassis?","that's a better one than i have been using. i was using the cousin one, this one i think will work better. thank you."

WhEn ArE yOu SuPpOsEd To UsE cApItAl LeTtErS?,"according to the British Royal Crown, you are supposed to capitalize the first letter of every sentence, and also the first word of important things or people, such as the Queen of England, or Harvard University. in my experience, this doesn't really help in communication, and almost hinders it, because you are giving off the impression that you are writing some kind of official document, and possibly not saying what you really mean. The times i prefer to use capitals are in acronyms (like NAFTA, or UNESCO), sometimes at the beginning of sentences if i feel i am changing gear or tone (similar to the way you might use a paragraph break) or also when i want to emphasize one word, i may capitalize the first letter of that word, creating something similar to a."

how much music (that isn't your own) do you listen to a day? Like do you do it often?,"i have one large randomized list, and i let it run mainly at 2 different times -- when i have a lot of questions to answer, and when i am alligning captions in a video. both are mindless tasks that don't require me to hear anything. also if i am walking a long distance, which is a hobby but i only do it when my car is being fixed."

im 14 and i want to start doing videos/music like you so i can have a purpose in life other than sleeping and i dont know where to start. please give me a step 1?,"do you have a computer? it may have default programs on it. i know a mac will probably have garage band and imovie. pc's may have something as well, i am not sure. Use those programs to do *anything* it absolutey doesn't matter what. Anything. just go through the motions of using those programs together. that is how you start doing exactly what i am doing. you will learn everything else from there."
do you ever notate your songs (like sheet music) and if so can we get some scores? also what is the color of your pillows. mine are a crazy purple?,"anything written before 2012 was written on paper. but many songs went through transformations during 2012/13, and from that time forward i was working in text and voice memos instead of paper. you can see some of the original charts for the older songs on expert mode."

"since you seem to have much more shorter content than longer content, which do you prefer making? I imagine that longer content is more difficult but is it overall more rewarding than shorter stuff? To me, they both seem equally as fun?","really short stuff is a good way to get started if you have wanted to make stuff for years but still haven't put anything out yet. it was a great trick! i was able to start putting stuff out, and i learned a lot. then i got really tired of doing short stuff and scaled it way back to start doing long stuff, but then all of a sudden my vine channel got a lot of attention, so i figured it was a bad time to stop. so i ended up doing even shorter content for ANOTHER 6 months, after i had already felt like i had done enough. it was still fun, and i learned a lot, but i was way overdue for some longer stuff. and then finally i couldn't take it anymore and took a risk and switched to longer stuff. only problem is it takes way longer to make, but i have done way way too much short stuff at this point. there's more than enough out there for people to watch."
cats or bats?,for what.
"this clave is not Nigerian, is it?. and if i'm not mistaken I think it goes like (and it starts on the last A)AaAaAAaAaAaA?","the 'clave' or whatever it's really called, has seemed to permeate the globe throughout every time period. but i can confirm, from playing in a nigerian church, that all the up-tempo songs are based rhythmically around 2 rhythms, which seem to correspond nearly exactly with what i have heard through the grape vine to be the so called clave rhythms. one in 4/4 using 16th notes (AaaAaaAaaaAaAaaa) and one at the same tempo using triplets instead, and the rhythm is (AaAaaAaAaAaa). they don't have a name for it, but it is always those 2 rhythms."
are you making any decent money off of Spotify? it seems like other musicians prefer Bandcamp cause they can a bigger cut of the money? i guess your probably more about what's convenient for your fans?,.

"Working on projects has never fallen into a flow for me unless I have a deadline. When I don't have a deadline they feel kind of dissatisfactory and give me a weird feeling in my stomach - it's kinda miserable. With deadlines I've been spurred into being really inspired and enjoyed the pressure. How's best to trick myself into having that pressure to work on stuff without having actual deadlines? (I know life is finite but that thought doesn't 'push' me a great deal, any other suggestions?)?","i know exactly what you mean, and i don't yet have a solution. i am looking for one."
are you a talkative person irl?,the amount of talking i do would depend on the amount of information i am trying to convey at that particular time.

Is your mom cool?,yes.
watching your reality videos makes me feel like I'm watching a documentary all about the making of your videos up until History of Japan. was that the intended purpose of these videos?,"if you are wondering if the entire purpose of my life from 2010 to 2016 was to make history of japan, the answer is no."
just wanted to let you know one of the reality videos is listed as 11.19.12 2:18am but it looks like it should be 11.19.10 2:18am?,thank you so much. it is fixed now.
did you get to meet Redfoo at the shorty awards?,no.
Does jazz NBC have anything to do with NBC other than the logo? (ie is the music in some way inspired by the company?)?,"absolutely not. this is following through on a random non-video idea i did as one of my first videos, which was to take a random jazz jam session (which would be a cover song, by the way) and just throw a random logo on it. jazz starbucks was the first one. for some reason it makes the music more listenable to have a random thing to stare at, i don't know why. i only did that a couple more times, and it's kind of a stupid idea i think. music was always taken from the."
is this an ok wuestion?,i guess.
"do you write your guitar parts based on how they would be played on guitar? it sounds like you know what you're doing (for example in burger king, go to the store, write a song on the count of 3, trees/everything, etc)?","just seems natural. i have played in many bands with guitars, and heard a lot of guitar music."
Please invent a new word?,i have already invented many. would prefer to uninvent some.
What do you do when you are really tired but can't fall asleep?,"think step by step on the current project i am working on. what is the next thing that needs to happen? what are the next questions that need to be asked? either i fall asleep thinking about those questions, or i spontaneously come up with what i need to do next and jump out of bed and do it."
hey do you take music recommendations?,no. but i receive them anyway.

but seriously though I am curious as to your emotional stateare the videos like I hate myself and I'm a piece of garbage accurate reflections of yourself or just something for fun?,"this is a common thought that goes through everyone's mind at one time or another. why not jingle-ify it? apparently it worked. those 2 had very high numbers on vine, especially the garbage one (which was actually a 2-part series)."
why is my lampshade green?,"i don't know, but mine is too. i like it."
"After following your stuff now for a bit, I think I see now that you really just want to make everything that you can possibly make.  (A fascinating pursuit, even if it's a bit strange.)  What I'm wondering though, is what this means for quality control?  So, for instance, would you rather create 100 kind-of okay-ish videos/songs, or 1 really really good one?  And if you found one specific thing that meant the world to you, would you be willing to drop everything to work on just that project, or would you rather be working on having more things done for people to see at the end of the day?  (sorry for this question being so wordy, i almost feel bad making you read all this)?","i am trying to do the best stuff i can. but sometimes if you are thinking like that, you won't do anything. at a certain point, you realize that every song or story is only good because there is something wrong with it. the main character has to have a problem in order for the story to mean anything. music has to have something 'bad' or 'wrong' about it, in order for you to feel the healing from that problem. So the more you try to search for the 'perfect' song, you will only realize that the only perfect song is total silence..... which is pointless. Over and over again i have tried to hone in on the right music and it continues to be impossible, and that is what has always led me to just dig in and start going crazy. in the end, i am a perfectionist, so even if i work on a very strange song or project, i am still going to take care to make sure that it is as good as possible. Also, very important to remember, is that the more you do, the better you get. this is the."
"What was the thinking behind the series where you sang about objects or other random live video (i.e. not graphics)? Such as bread, tape, iron my shoes, colonization, mail you my floor?","it was just a good way to start out making videos when i didn't really know what to do, but felt like i could do anything. the first 3 were done in 2011 (bed, bowl, foot) and then i didn't do any videos for a long time (was mostly writing and recording songs.) then in 2014 i spontaneously put together a 5-day video."
how DO you get organized enough to start really creating content? i'm really bad at this and would like advice?,"wait and stay confused for as long as possible, until you can't take it anymore. for details on how i did it, click."

Do you ever play your originals at your gigs? I understand that its like strictly for work and not part of the bill wurtz experience but some of your tracks like new cannan or i can play could probably be done live fairly easily (even if doesnt sound the exact same)?,i don't do my own gigs.
"What about doin a history of youtube adsvideo?That would be a great idea, probably one of your FAVOURITE?","it would be the same as history of ads on any other platform, and it goes like this, wow, a cool new medium, with no ads OOPS nevermind."
Video games?Which ones?Thank you for NARDS?,
"If the secret to immortality was discovered, and you could live forever, would that actually solve your problem of make all the things, for infinity?  Like, does having an infinite amount of time actually permit an infinite amount of things, or do the two infinities just sort of converge at some point and you end up with something inbetween everything and nothing?  (also do you even think along these lines, sorry if this makes no sense)?",it would solve some problems and probably create entirely different problems.

Have you received offers to create paid content? (e.g. Song to accompany an advert on tv)?,all the time.

(like not specifically FOR them, but with them in mind during the writing process)?","well, there is one that references bob marley ... there is another one that references jodi foster, mel gibson, and junior murvin, ... i can't think of any others."
"I noticed that you talk a lot about how you feel pressured to get a lot of content done because of getting older, having a finite amount of time, etc but you don't seem very old, I'm guessing in your 20s still, with a lot of time to accomplish a lot of things. What caused you to have that fear of not having enough time? (I hope you aren't like ailing or anything)?",you may not realize the amount of content i am talking about.
can we take our relationship to the next level?,sure.
I wish i could just forget all your content and then watch/read it entirely over from scratch. Do you ever wish this?,i wish i could make all the rest of the content i've written faster so you could see it faster.
how do i get cool and popular like you?,"first, get unpopular enough that you are free to decide for yourself what cool is. then do it until people start paying attention. and then when no one pays attention, keep doing it anyway."
