I have little skill in music; words are my clay, and I can sculpt them to any shape I desire...but what is the link between the beauty of words and the resplendence of music?","there are many different ways of doing all this, but in my experience, the music picks up a lot of the slack. most great songs look very short on paper (if you just look at the lyrics), and also look very nothing. most times when people write things that are meant to stand on their own without music, and then try to put to music, there is usually way too much content to fit in a song, and often there are many words that look good on paper but just aren't very singable. then again, this can be done many many different ways. the only way i know is to do it all at the same time. i think songwriting might be more similar to writing a script for a movie than poetry."

do you feel relevant?,to what.
"ok i've got first verse, chorus, second verse, second chorus. now what?","take a deep breath, and run through the song. the song already has a strong identity. ask the song what it needs, if anything. to do this right, you need to keep cleaering your head and running the song from the beginning, and right as you are getting to the end of the second chorus, that's when you will have the clearest idea of what needs to happen. Remember to remain open to all possibilities! including nothing. this part of songwriting is something i call finishing because there is really no telling what it's going to need. every song is different. i've heard so many songs that in my opinion fail at 'finishing' because they didn't take proper care to figure out what's best for that song. in other words, having a bridge when there shouldn't be a bridge. having the wrong kind of bridge. bridges are unpredictable anyway and this ties in with the 'be open to anything' strategy. this is a very sensitive part of the process, and every song needs something distinctly different, and quite possibly nothing. you will only know clearly after doing a full run through, and start paying attention about halfway through second chorus. many times your next step will be something that almost interrupts the end of the chorus to go to a different thing. other examples of things that work in some songs are: another verse with no lyrics. another chorus with no lyrics. maybe a totally different thing with no lyrics. another chorus with different lyrics. a totally different thing with lyrics. but this is a sensitive issue and every song has very distinctive needs, so you need to make sure you are doing full run throughs and really let the song decide what it needs or doesn't need."

What font do you use.. Helvetica? and why?,"i used to worry about different fonts for everything, but that became not only a waste of time, but also distracting from a viewing standpoint. i ultimately made a decision to actually use the default font for everything. it gave me a lot of creative clarity, and greater efficiency. i learned it's better to focus on your strong points, and don't worry about things that are not your strong points. i don't make my own fonts, and i don't have access to a large font libary, so this would not be a strong point. by religiously using the default font only, i found that i could instantly put all my focus on things that are my strong points -- positioning, angles, motion, and timing."
you have sheet music available for some of your songs? where?,"just the original writing, not a transcript. so in many cases this would be years before it was recorded, and might not include all the detail as the recording (and might even have changed on the recording). they would be on the expert page, and most of them are probably from 2010 or earlier."

What would you do if someone gave you lemons?,"not currently accepting lemons, i apologize."
Why didn't you monetize?,"because ads ruin my life when i see them. the least i can do for the viewers is not subject them to the same torture. people come to my page for the memes, the jokes, the music, the ideas, who knows what, but they don't come to be repeatedly tortured and taunted into buying stuff."

"i know you work alone, I get that. but have you ever tried creating with another person? The biggest advantage I take out of this is because it is more fun, to laugh with another one. keep up the good work! love you?","trust me, the only reason i work alone is because i have to. i spent years and years thinking you were supposed to collaborate, and that i was just messed up for not being able to make it work. i knew i could do it alone, but i thought it was frowned upon. and i knew it would certainly be more enjoyable and less lonely to work together with someone. but i very rarely found anyone i could work with, and i tried many many times to collaborate and failed miserably. i just always wanted to take it to mars way too quickly. no one would really take me seriously. while the whole time i thought i was the one being serious. finally i saw an interview with a very successful songwriter about collaboration, and he said i actually don't collaborate well. one of the reasons i like songwriting is because it's something you can actually do all by yourself. that's when i finally stopped feeling guilty about it, and that's when the real work started. ever since then everything has been going fine, although i am still lonely."

Like did you do 2hrs three days a week every month, or did you only do it when you found the time?","i don't see how learning music would ever work on a scheduled basis. i have only heard i hated it and quit stories from people who have tried to do it that way. it's like a drug. you do it and you get obsessed. then maybe you get obsessed with something else, and that's ok too. i learned most of the basics when i was very young, like 2 to 10 years old, but i also spent long periods of time on other things, like drums, card tricks, whatever."

are romantic relationships important to you personally? like do you think you'd be happier if had a partner or are you indifferent about it?,"it's extremely important, and i think about it every day. i have had a huge amount of difficulty with it, and i have learned that talking about it here actually only makes it worse, because yes i do want people to reach out to me, but i usually have a lot of difficulty connecting, and that makes people understandably very angry at me.  i'm really an impossible case, and that's not anyone's fault except probably mine. i am actually hoping to find someone who is equally impossible, if possible."

"the old computer that I'm using to make music on is giving up on me before I can complete or save my projects. if you were in this situation, would you try to recreate the progress, or start over from scratch?","not sure if i understand the question. parts of the question sound like your project crashed and you are considering starting over, in which case i would advise you to learn to save more regularly. however, other parts of the question suggest that your computer crashes too frequently for it to be possible to save anything, in which case starting again would be incredibly dumb because you are going to lose it again."

Will you do another history video? It was one of the only times I thoroughly enjoyed learning something that won't help me in life?,
"I read your answer to my last question but I was quite confused. I am familiar with popular words cause everybody use them all the time. Then you are familiar with pop music cause people hear it all the time, I suppose.

is the thank you on your thank you page misspelt intentionally?,yes.
"this may be a bit of a private question and feel free not to answer, but have you ever had to through a phase of emotional distraught and/or depression?","sure, especially back when i was still trying to figure out what i was doing in the world. ever since i got on track towards doing what i'm doing, everything has been incredibly stable, compared to how it was before."

Opinion of King Henry VIII?,i think he's doing a great job so far.
what software do u use?,
why is so much modern jazz still stuck in head-solo-solo-solo-trading-head form? and do we really need a bass solo in every tune?,"i think they are holding onto traditions because they are afraid of offending the 'institution.' ironically, when jazz was originally popular, it didn't really use those devices. back then it followed the same rules as all popular music: sing the damn song and do it good."
what note is the best note?,"that's hard to answer, because the main reason notes are good is because they are bad."
"hey Bill, I loved the mariah carey example of the good old 5min to setup the 4. really cool to see the progession reduced to its core, and probably one of the most refreshing 3 chords song. Know another 3 chord song that can surprise the listener?",umm...... ram on.
How long did it take you to make History of Japan?,
"What do you think of songs with progressions that are used a lot?  Do you think the world doesn't need another song like that or it depends on the song? Have you ever composed something and thought this is stupid, this has been done over a thousand times and it is not worth it or that's just a stupid thought?","i feel the same way about common chord progressions as i do about the 4-wheels design on cars, or the left-right-left-right walking pattern. it has been done, and anyone who uses it should be ashamed."
where's that terms page you did here explaining your take and nomenclature of mccartneyisms and more? thanks Bill.,"i deleted it, as always, due to public scrutiny (see question below).  i would be glad to discuss those topics privately, in much greater detail."
"You nearly always cite a lot of really Pop (mainstream radio music) references in your theory related answers. Do you listen to it cause you enjoy, or just to study, or you listen to it cause that type of music's always surrounding us (so you just hear it and analyze it anyway), etc ?",i will explain why i am familiar with popular music if you can explain why you are familiar with popular words (like 'it' and 'and').
Why do the good die young?,all types of people die at all different ages. i really don't see a correlation. one possible explaination is that our respect for someone usually rises after they are dead.
How do you balance witty-online-cynicism and compassionate humility? How many focus groups did it take? Thank you for much (more than i probably now realize)?,"it's simple, just do them both.  each one helps the other one mean more. there's no greater feeling than a joke that feels meaningful, or a meaningful statement that feels funny. it's even more fun when you can't figure out which one it is."
"Hey, I see you answering a lot of questions about chords in songs, but what about lyrics?  Do you find yourself much of a poet, or do you tend to focus mainly on melodies?",it all works together. that's the way it works. i often delete chord questions after answering because people read it and get the wrong idea. it all works together.
What are your opinions on fame?,"it's a fun challenge, with riddles and perils."
"Why do i want to ask you a question?p.s. i don't expect you to be able to tell me, but that doesn't preclude an answer?",because there's no other option.
Can I ask a question?,
"I've run out of originality and humor, how much are you selling yours for?",buying or selling originality or humor is the least original or humorous thing you could possibly do.
How do we know that you are not making up questions that you're answering yourself?,"that's a great question, and there's absolutely no way i can prove i'm not doing that. but i'm not doing that."
"Do you love me and, if not, are you playing your love games with me?",do you possibly realize that i can't answer that question if i don't know who this is? please. this is a site for logic and reasoning. you are wasting everyone's time.

"hey Bill,have you got a name for that classic soul progression that goes VI-V-Im-VIIm-III-VI-V -Im? Like just the two of us or if you want me to stay (but in this case already beggining in the root), and have you ever heard any nice twists to it?Keep up the good work! Love you?","i don't have a name for it, other than to say it's the good old 5min to set up the 4 except it's used from the perspective of the relative minor. so like, if you're in a minor key, it's when you go ahead and smack the flat7min7, to set up the b6.  honestly, a pretty slick version of this which you might get a kick out of, is in the verse of 'let me love you one more time' (benson). and then there's obviously biggie's 'big poppa' which i believe is actually just isley brothers. also check out the second verse of a song called You by mya, on the word grow. this one has the extra passing tone thrown in for bonus points. Also, another twist i just thought of -- a lot of songs do like a 2-5 and then another 2-5 a whole step lower -- so it actually kind of has that same effect when it hits the 2 of the second 2-5-- sounds like the b7min7. example of that would be c'est la vie by robbie neville. 'love' by musiq does another one chromatically in the verse, but the melody doesn't obey it as well as the 'mya' example.  here's one that may seem subtle -- there was a mariah carey song (maybe 2006??) called 'shake it off it's really just 3 chord hits, but it implies the same thing. t-pain 'show you how' also uses it pretty quick. also 'luv' by janet jackson uses it very expertly, with a gold-plated tritone substitution thing for the inbetween chord. basically all these are the b7min7 (to usually set up the b6) from a minor key. hope that's what you meant, i'm just taking that as the main common thread between your examples. ultimately this is a good technique, which i bet not many people know nowadays, and it is surely a great way to get chicks."
How do you create your animations?,basic motion and keyframes. it's hard work unless you keep it simple.
Do you censor these questions?,fuck no.
"have you ever considered making a list of lists so we can conveniently see the frequently asked questions and answers in a single convenient hub, so as to avoid asking you the same things?",it's actually pretty easy to see if a question has been asked. just cmd-F (or ctrl-F) to search this page. just search for the main word in your question (like eggs) and press cmd-G (or ctrl G) to jump through the mentions.
"how do you deal with the: oh, this chord feels nice. oh, this one feels better. oh, this one is actually better than the two before. oh, this one is kinda in between, etc. whenever I'm making a song I can't help but think whether the chords I used were the best. Have you ever felt like this?","yes, absolutely. i will nitpick every little thing, often even how loud to play each note of the chord. there's basically 2 solutions: worry about it forever, or stop worrying about it Now. after you stop worrying about it and put out a couple (or a hundred)  really sloppy songs, you will eventually realize you are bulletproof enough to venture to worry about the chords just the right amount. but you will never get there unless you lower your standards enough to get the machine moving. also, plot twist, if you really are as sensitive as you say you are, even your sloppiest version is actually going to be pretty great."
"So, you think walls are a hoax... What are your opinions on doors? (I haven't seen your opinion on doors yet and I am curious)?",are you kidding? half my material is about doors.
"But bill, your the wind beneath my wings. Marry me.","i don't have time for jokes on this subject. i am a very lonely person. if you think you and i are compatible, for fuck's sake send me an email and tell me about yourself. i am desperately looking for the right person. taunting me on a public page with nameless marriage proposals is not constructive."

"Notice you don't really use a guitar in your compositions? Any specific reason why or just preference? Maj 7, Min 7, add 9, add 7 chords can all sound really groovy with the right tone :D?","i love guitars just as much as anyone, but when i make records it's all midi. a midi-only approach is the only thing that makes sense for me. i've been doing it since i was 10, and it is a drastically more efficient use of my particular skill sets, and also given the fact that i'm working by myself."
"Out of curiousity, what made you pick Japan for your first long video?",
"Hi Bill, can I help you remove some songs from your list of songs to cover? My suggestions are More Than A Feeling by Boston, Separate Ways by Journey, and Lithium by Nirvana. I think you could do without covering those songs, as you had originally planned. What do you think?","honestly, i really appreciate the help. the 1st two were actually not on the list, the 3rd one is. but i don't think i can get rid of it, lithium is a very strong contender. it has a lot of potential."
are you going to continue making short videos?,"i would like to do as many different types of things as possible. in the past 2 years (actually 10 years) i've had to do much more short stuff than i wanted, because it was really the only way to get off the ground. i hope to correct that balance a bit-- i would like to do things of every length. 40 sec, 1min05 sec, 3min15 sec, ... all the lengths are great, and should be explored."
Make an evolution video?,ok.
Do you think you can cover You Suffer (But Why?) by Napalm Death in your own style? Give it a listen.,"i have been compiling a list of songs i want to cover. there are about 800 songs in the list. every song in the list is one i desperately, desperately want to cover. only a few of them will ever get done. at this point i need help removing songs from the list, not adding them."

The tritone sub and the bVII7 sub got good reviews, but the remaining III7 sub is supposed to be the one that doesn't work so great. I know that Rachmaninoff used it, though, as a way to deceptively resolve to the relative major of a minor tonic.

If so, how do you reign yourself back in when it's not very interesting at that moment to work on?","this is an 'angel's voice, tapping you on the shoulder and saying 'are you sure this is the right project?' so you lay around for a few hours and contemplate the question. and if you are sure it is, then that's the go ahead. if you still feel things are moving slowly, then go to a microscopic next-step approach. also perhaps you are a bit off track in this section of the project. consider tightening up or drastically simplifying that particular part of the project. that will often clear things right up, and get you right back to focusing on your original reasons for doing the whole thing in the first place. it's like a tree. you are way out on the branches. get back to the trunk, that branch ur on might not even matter."

Your videos and music make me feel better and more like a person because they are something that I can relate too yet also find joy out of. When you first started uploading music, was your intention to connect to people in this way or in any other way regarding emotions and things like that, or was it more for a purely self-indulgent hobby that you didn't expect an audience to gravitate to? Either way, I'm very glad that you're so dedicated to what you produce and thankful that you exist in the online community.","as soon as i realized everything was actually ok, it became very important for me to tell everybody about it. because i figured a lot of people probably don't know."

I know you want to do all your creative work by yourself. That's understandable. But do you realize that means only about 5 (long) videos per year at this rate? What about focusing on the creative part but using some technical help/technical assistance from another person(s)? Many people would love to help you with time-consuming technical stuff so you could concentrate on the pure creative decisions and in the end do more videos (both music and research) until you die. Just let somebody help you so you could achieve more. It would still be your creative work. Please consider this.,i think that will eventually be the way it works. it takes a lot of time to build that kind of trust in someone. right now the only contact i have with the outside world is people sending me emails like hi here's a picture of my cat etc. i also don't make enough to pay people properly for the kind of work i need them to do. in time i think it will come together.

I also find it difficult to voice and voice lead my own songs, especially when voicing multiple instruments together such as piano, rhodes, organ, guitar, vocals, etc. How do I get better with voicings?","i never really figured out what people mean when they say 'voice leading.' i honestly think terms like that are empty and not useful. i find a lot of terms useful, but not that one. just do what sounds good man. as far as getting all those instruments you mentioned to work together, i will say: don't have too many things going on at the same time. and other than that, the only way to learn is experience. always start with less instruments, it gets out of hand fast."

how do you website?,"make html pages using text, then save them in a folder.  then you have to buy hosting and a domain name, and get an FTP program to upload the files to the site. simple html is actually really easy, you can pretty much just copy from examples (from sites like w3schools) and change things until it's what you want. that being said, if you are learning things by yourself and doing it from scratch, the website will probably look like it was made by a 13 year old in 1997."

What confuses you about the concept of favourites?,"most things are made up of so many different elements, many of which can be so likable and/or unlikable in so many different ways. even if you could figure out whether you 'like' an entire thing, then you would have to figure out if you actually like it more or less than another thing. and then on top of that, you expect that to never change? it's a mindfuck."

"i will have my own music and visual studio..i will also have a great band and live show this imperative attitude is commonplace for people who achieve brilliant things.
