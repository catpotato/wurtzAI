Then again, you'd probably have to make an individual page for each one, which would be time consuming.  But then i guess you could just link directly to youtube.  idk where i was going with this?","i think they would run slower if i did that. also it is extremely important that it runs without glitches once it loads, and also to be able to have quick access to any point in the video, easy pause/unpause, etc. all those things are made extremely difficult on youtube. also, easy downloadability is something i value above all else. the ultimate viewing experience is watching it on your hard drive, in my opinion. that's why it is extremely important to me to provide that experience for people. that's what this site is for- i'm giving you all this content. for those who prefer the youtube experience, they can watch on youtube. and for the shorter ones i would recommend vine."

"in order to maximise originality, do you avoid listening to or watching other people's work? You seem to place a large focus on doing what other people don't do, so surely seeing other people's stuff would affect your subconscious? Thanks?","i think you're right, but the real reason is i don't have time. i do make an effort to keep up with popular radio, but if i want to succeed at what i'm doing it requires full time hard work, so that's the more realistic reason why consuming of other content is sometimes neglected. if i spent my time watching other peoples' content, you would see much less content from me, and there is already not enough, in my opinion. i hope that makes sense."

"i know you work alone, I get that. but have you ever tried creating with another person? The biggest advantage I take out of this is because it is more fun, to laugh with another one. keep up the good work! love you?","trust me, the only reason i work alone is because i have to. i spent years and years thinking you were supposed to collaborate, and that i was just messed up for not being able to make it work. i knew i could do it alone, but i thought it was frowned upon. and i knew it would certainly be more enjoyable and less lonely to work together with someone. but i very rarely found anyone i could work with, and i tried many many times to collaborate and failed miserably. i just always wanted to take it to mars way too quickly. no one would really take me seriously. while the whole time i thought i was the one being serious. finally i saw an interview with a very successful songwriter about collaboration, and he said i actually don't collaborate well. one of the reasons i like songwriting is because it's something you can actually do all by yourself. that's when i finally stopped feeling guilty about it, and that's when the real work started. ever since then everything has been going fine, although i am still lonely."

"hey Bill,have you got a name for that classic soul progression that goes VI-V-Im-VIIm-III-VI-V -Im? Like just the two of us or if you want me to stay (but in this case already beggining in the root), and have you ever heard any nice twists to it?Keep up the good work! Love you?","i don't have a name for it, other than to say it's the good old 5min to set up the 4 except it's used from the perspective of the relative minor. so like, if you're in a minor key, it's when you go ahead and smack the flat7min7, to set up the b6.  honestly, a pretty slick version of this which you might get a kick out of, is in the verse of 'let me love you one more time' (benson). and then there's obviously biggie's 'big poppa' which i believe is actually just isley brothers. also check out the second verse of a song called You by mya, on the word grow. this one has the extra passing tone thrown in for bonus points. Also, another twist i just thought of -- a lot of songs do like a 2-5 and then another 2-5 a whole step lower -- so it actually kind of has that same effect when it hits the 2 of the second 2-5-- sounds like the b7min7. example of that would be c'est la vie by robbie neville. 'love' by musiq does another one chromatically in the verse, but the melody doesn't obey it as well as the 'mya' example.  here's one that may seem subtle -- there was a mariah carey song (maybe 2006??) called 'shake it off it's really just 3 chord hits, but it implies the same thing. t-pain 'show you how' also uses it pretty quick. also 'luv' by janet jackson uses it very expertly, with a gold-plated tritone substitution thing for the inbetween chord. basically all these are the b7min7 (to usually set up the b6) from a minor key. hope that's what you meant, i'm just taking that as the main common thread between your examples. ultimately this is a good technique, which i bet not many people know nowadays, and it is surely a great way to get chicks."

RIP Prince?,"i guess technically there is no difference, but modal stuff i would consider more actually based in the key of the root. like dorian would be like 'so what' or 'can i get a'. and lydian (which is usually more of a momentary thing anyway) would be like the intro to a steven spielberg movie. this question will self destruct."
